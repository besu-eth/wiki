## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the Hyperledger projects, we'd love to hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.

Besu uses a dedicated security list: [security-besu@lists.hyperledger.org.](mailto:security-besu@lists.hyperledger.org.)

The members are:

Gary Schulte, Consensys  
Jason Frame, Consensys  
Fabio Difabio, Consensys  
Sally MacFarlane, Consensys  
Karim Taam, Consensys  
Ry Jones, Linux Foundation  
Hart Montgomery, Linux Foundation  
Danno Ferrin, independent
