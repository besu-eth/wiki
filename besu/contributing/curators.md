# Curators

Curators have "triage" access to the Besu GitHub repository which means they can

- curate, manage, label and otherwise categorize bugs and other Github issues for Besu,
- collaborate with the existing maintainers to help coordinate the development and roadmap planning of Besu

This means they have the ability to label and close GitHub issues, helping to keep the project tidy.

This role tends to be held by Product Managers (PMs). All are currently employed by ConsenSys.

The process for becoming a Curator is separate from the [process for becoming a Besu maintainer](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md). 

Access is controlled by this GitHub [group](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/besu-triage/members). 

## Granting access

PMs that need access are nominated by a maintainer they work with

- post a message to the besu-contributors Discord channel introducing them and their role

And nomination confirmed by an existing Curator

- reply to the nomination/introduction post in the besu-contributors Discord channel
- tag or direct message to a maintainer of the GitHub group to add the new member, and then access is granted

There is no voting or other approval. The combined reputation of the nominating maintainer and confirming Curator is sufficient "social proof" for membership.

## Removing access

A maintainer communicates that the Curator is no longer in the role needing access.

- post a message to the besu-contributors Discord channel

Access is removed after confirming (or after reasonable effort to do so) with the Curator being removed.

- tag or direct message to a maintainer of the GitHub [group](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/besu-triage/members), and then access is removed

## Historical record

The membership of the besu-triage group is the record of current Curators. No other record is kept.
