# Configure and format Markdown

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a Python tool that generates the static HTML documentation site that is published.

Besu documentation uses the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme to render the HTML pages. It also comes with useful [extensions](https://consensys.net/docs/doctools/en/latest/contribute/markdown/extensions/).

## MkDocs configuration

For sites using the [old documentation system](https://consensys.net/docs/doctools/en/latest/overview/#old-documentation-system), MkDocs is configured in the `mdkocs.yml` file at the root of the repository. This file configures:

- Site metadata and variables.
- Theme.
- Page navigation.
- Extensions.
- Plugins.
- Page redirects.

If you add pages to the documentation (rather than updating existing pages), add your new pages to the `nav` section of `mkdocs.yml`.

If you move an existing page to another location or rename it, the public path changes. Create a redirect in the `redirects` section of `mkdocs.yml`.

## Format Markdown for documentation

Having a standard for formatting Markdown helps writers and reviewers navigate the code and review changes. The following are rules for formatting Markdown in Besu documentation:

- Each Markdown file must contain a header composed of [metadata](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/extensions/python-markdown/#metadata) and limited by three dashes (`-`).Example:

`---`  
`title: Installation overview`  
`description: Overview and requirements to install the software`  
`---`

- For the rest of the Markdown code, each line should be (roughly) [limited to 100 columns long](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.4-column-limit) to be readable on any editor. You’ll receive a warning, not an error, if you exceed 100 columns. Lines must be wrapped without cutting the line in the middle of a word. One line break displays as a space.Example:

`In this example, this first sentence exceeds 100 characters, so we recommend wrapping it into`  
`multiple lines. One line break displays as a space, so this Markdown renders as one paragraph without line breaks.`  
`We also recommend starting each new sentence on a new line, even if the previous line didn't reach`  
`100 columns, for easy reviewing.`  
`You can set a column marker in your text editor as a heuristic.`

- Use only one first level title (prefixed with a single `#`) on a page.
- No HTML markup can be used inside a Markdown document. There are many extensions you can use that have similar capabilities without HTML.There’s one exception where HTML is tolerated: tables that are too complex and already exist. If possible, keep the table simple without any elements other than `table`, `tr`, and `td`.
- If using Markdown tables, format them so they’re also readable in the source code. For example, add an appropriate number of spaces to align the columns in the source code.Example:

`| Syntax    | Description |`  
`| --------- | ----------- |`  
`| Name      | Title       |`  
`| Paragraph | Text        |`

   You can quickly formate tables by using [Markdown Table Formatter](http://markdowntable.com/) or create tables from scratch using [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).

- Code samples should be written so that users can copy and paste them with minimal editing and have them work as expected.
