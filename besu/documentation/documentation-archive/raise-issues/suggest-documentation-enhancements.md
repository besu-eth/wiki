# Suggest documentation enhancements

You can submit a documentation enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements, by [creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) in the [Besu documentation repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/issues).

**Before submitting an enhancement suggestion,** perform a cursory search ofÂ [project issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**When submitting an enhancement suggestion,** use the following guidelines to help maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

- **Use a clear and descriptive summary** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links, search keywords which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use backticks (\`\`\`) to format the code snippets.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you demonstrate the steps where possible.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
