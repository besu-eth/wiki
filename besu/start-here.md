# Start Here

Welcome!

Assuming you've already read the [Code of Conduct](../besu/code-of-conduct.md), read on.

Please join our [Discord](../besu/contributing/discord.md) - it's the best place to ask if you have any questions.

To start developing with Besu, you'll want to know how to [build from source](../besu/developing-and-conventions/building-from-source.md) and be familiar with [coding conventions](../besu/developing-and-conventions/coding-conventions.md), and how to [run the tests locally](../besu/developing-and-conventions/testing.md).

There’s a few different ways to build and run Besu [https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/install](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/install)

- since The Merge, you need to run besu with a CL - see [https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/tutorials/besu-teku-mainnet](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/tutorials/besu-teku-mainnet) - checkpoint sync is pretty quick
- Note that doing a full sync will take days and take up TB of disk space. Checkpoint is a good option if testing locally. Some info on resource requirements [https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/system-requirements](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/system-requirements)
