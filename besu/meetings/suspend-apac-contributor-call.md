# Suspend APAC Contributor Call

I am proposing that we suspend the APAC timezone contributor call because the only contributors that attend are from Consensys.Â 

Any APAC-friendly contributor-level discussion can be done async in Discord as it already is, or async via the US/EMEA contributor call agenda.

Of course, if anyone wants an APAC ad-hoc call or to restart the regular call, they are welcome to suggest it.

Last call was [2024-03-26 Contributor Call - APAC Friendly Time](../meetings/agendas/2024-agendas/2024-03-26-contributor-call-apac-friendly-time.md)
