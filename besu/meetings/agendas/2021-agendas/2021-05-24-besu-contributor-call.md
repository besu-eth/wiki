- General Announcements
  - A few contributors and maintainers from ConsenSys will be at the global forum 
  - Grace is facilitating panel on use-cases on Besu, Lucas is hosting Besu demo 
  - Danno presenting Bonzai demo, Goerli demo, Ethereum layer 2 related to Hyperledger
  - Hyperledger Besu certification survey results are in! 
  - Working on Rocketchat bridge to ConsenSys Discord
  - Working on global Meetups to cross-promote on Hyperledger <> BUIDL network
- Release updates
  - New Release: Besu 21.1.6 
    - [https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/21.1.6](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/21.1.6)
- Work Updates
  - Non-technical contributors to become maintainers
    - Restrictions for maintainers that are non-technical can be recognized
    - Vijay and Sajida have been added as maintainers based on their product leadership
    - We should do a poll in Rocketchat for: (1) what is stopping you from contributing to Besu (2) why are you deterred from contributing to Besu? 
    - Could we incentivize contributors to create more tutorials in a repo for the community? We have quorum-quickstart-dev, but could there be more developer tools for demonstrating privacy/permissioning upon deployment (we need more contributors!)
  - Experimental Bonsai trie benchmark results
    - Karim update: Took over Bonsai work since Danno left
    - Since March 20, we had two mainnet nodes syncing 
    - 1TB vs .5 TB without Bonsi trie improvements 
    - Force node without pruning - 12TB 
    - 50% improvement in storage usage with bonsai enhancements 
  - Post Rayonism update
    - Rayonism went well! 
    - Besu as an execution client was the most stable execution client; top performer! 
    - On Nocturne testnet, we did some things with type transactions, but had very little to do 
    - We integrated with Teku/Prysm/Lighthouse (couldn't get Nimbus up in time) 
    - Had really good results with all four on the second trial
    - Working on getting Besu broader adoption as an execution environment; de facto execution engine for Teku
    - Antoine to assist Gary with Rayonism work (consult)
    - Next -> 
      - No new testnet 
      - Withdrawal and partial withdrawal work
      - ETH1 hardfork will need to happen for next steps
  - ETC
    - Magneto hard fork 
    - Antoine is close with ETC and working on mining improvements using Besu 
      - Besu support for pool methods (reject list, blacklist IPs), more open issues in Github
    - Besu is an ideal client for ETC miners but requires some improvements/ fixed issues 
  - 1559 update
    - Getting close - London configs are in testnets 
    - Doing work with Dimitry and Ari on reference tests 
    - Besu is only ETH1 client that does RPC tests right now
    - Transaction pool modification code is getting difficult to follow 
    - Refactoring code so we can optimize
    - Karim is working on late breaking update 
    - Code freeze right now 
    - Getting everything under the wire for first testnet release June 2nd
    - All things aside: great shape!
