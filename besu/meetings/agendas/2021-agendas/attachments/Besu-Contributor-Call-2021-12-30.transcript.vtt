All right.

60
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.160
Grace Hartley: i'm thinking kick off.

61
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.200
Grace Hartley: i'm pleasantly surprised by the number of people, we have thanks everyone for being on December 30 sure y'all want to spend some time with your family.

62
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.420
Grace Hartley: We have an hour here, this is kind of a continuation of the call we had last week.

63
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.770
Grace Hartley: Around the ETF incentive Program.

64
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.920
Grace Hartley: i'll pull up the agenda here.

65
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.180
just looking.

66
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.530
At.

67
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:19.020
Grace Hartley: Well, it has 2022 agendas that's we don't need that just yet just for reference dropping the link in the chat from the call from last week, where we had took a bunch of notes so just if you are not there or want to engage there.

68
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:31.500
Grace Hartley: Are reference back that's where they are the agenda for this call today is the one I just posted to kick off probably worth 13 with housekeeping.

69
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.160
Grace Hartley: antitrust notice you please review that.

70
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.310
Grace Hartley: That just fyi obviously needs already being recorded.

71
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:57.390
Grace Hartley: If you do don't want to be on a recording Please go ahead and drop, then please mute speaking, and then we like to use the raise hand feature as we can just to make sure we're facilitate the conversation with group so that would be pretty.

72
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.660
Grace Hartley: cool so.

73
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.330
Grace Hartley: I think what we were.

74
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.710
Grace Hartley: proposed agenda.

75
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.320
Grace Hartley: For this call is kind of two parts.

76
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:23.820
Grace Hartley: One is maybe the first 30 minutes or so we'll see what we do kind of talking about the incentive program and a few proposals ideas around around that and then the second part is just kind of basic maintainer like progress Community concerns and.

77
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.210
Grace Hartley: and addressing that as well.

78
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.640
Grace Hartley: First of all, does that sound all right does anyone have anything to add or change.

79
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.010
Grace Hartley: Okay, so we will do that and see how it goes.

80
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:50.670
Grace Hartley: And then, but we'll kick off with the incentive program so just, I guess, maybe a 32nd reminder of what you talked about even just to refresh myself.

81
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.830
Grace Hartley: Essentially, the ef during foundation is.

82
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.200
Grace Hartley: Creating this incentive program for your clients to.

83
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:11.100
Grace Hartley: Basically, you know certain hit certain milestones based on their performance and they're incentivizing it through.

84
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.410
Grace Hartley: Money basically.

85
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:25.110
Grace Hartley: Three so we're here today to just kind of so you kind of threw out a few ideas around you know what the incentive program looks like last time we're not going to go through all that you go back and look at the recording.

86
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:39.210
Grace Hartley: But today I just wanted to kind of kick off the wheels turning on what what could be you know kind of structure for hyper ledger base you to manage its own incentive program and go from there that's about right anything I missed.

87
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.120
Gary Schulte: sounds good cool.

88
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.130
Grace Hartley: So maybe i'll let Gary you kick off, I know you have kind of a few ideas or.

89
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.360
yeah.

90
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.130
Grace Hartley: yeah.

91
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.580
Grace Hartley: yeah and.

92
00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:04.860
Grace Hartley: Discussions around what what could be maybe a basic hour or something like that maybe you just give the idea overview and then talk about kind of some things were thrown out as options.

93
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:15.690
Gary Schulte: yeah so I threw a link to hacking be in chat here just for some talking points I had some conversations with Brian some conversations with TIM and just a little bit of research.

94
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:24.780
Gary Schulte: On what rocket pool is doing with their trust lists sticking I do want to start, though I mentioned at the beginning that.

95
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.400
Gary Schulte: The.

96
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:34.200
Gary Schulte: The grant program or the validate validator reward program whatever the F, is calling it I forget this is.

97
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:44.310
Gary Schulte: Just to remind you this isn't entirely encumbered grant this there's not like they're giving us a pile of money and saying hey go do this, what they're doing is they're giving us an incentive to.

98
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:58.110
Gary Schulte: participate and be a viable merge client and participate in merge consensus post merge with base who specifically so there's no there's no money that's actually given to us.

99
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:09.060
Gary Schulte: Except that way will perform these duties as validators on the network for 144 validator stakes, and they will be incrementally.

100
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:17.880
Gary Schulte: We will incrementally invest into them as we move through the program I wish TIM was going to be able to be on the call asked if he could but.

101
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.730
Gary Schulte: he's unfortunate he's on a plane.

102
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.100
Gary Schulte: I think if I did my arithmetic correctly, I think that the full.

103
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:32.160
Gary Schulte: stake vests over a period of six years, and I think each 12 month.

104
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.020
Gary Schulte: calendar.

105
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:46.290
Gary Schulte: cycle vests equally in every month, so like if they're say the first year first calendar year that the program is active there would be.

106
00:08:47.160 --> 00:09:01.470
Gary Schulte: one sixth of the hundred 44 validators that would invest every month I forget the exact arithmetic I don't want to do quick arithmetic on the phone, but I don't think it quite adds up to something divisible by 12 but we'll let them do the logistics of that.

107
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:09.630
Gary Schulte: Anyway, point being this isn't encumbered grant so this isn't this isn't a pile of money that we can just kind of distribute so.

108
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.320
Gary Schulte: That says.

109
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.940
Rai: When withdrawals enabled right.

110
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.110
Gary Schulte: What was that again.

111
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.120
Rai: It starts when withdrawals are enabled.

112
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.460
Gary Schulte: Well yeah when withdrawals are enabled.

113
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.820
Gary Schulte: I think that's when the vesting begins yeah you're right.

114
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.330
yeah.

115
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:22.980
Justin Florentine: Right.

116
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:29.130
Justin Florentine: Go ahead it's it's even then, if there's a fall off right it's only partially.

117
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.660
Gary Schulte: accepted there's a there's a.

118
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:41.820
Gary Schulte: An annual there's an annual schedule once vesting does begin once vesting starts within a calendar your that whole that first partial calendar year is going to be an entire calendar year like kind of with an accelerated vesting for that first.

119
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.260
Gary Schulte: year during that window.

120
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.510
Gary Schulte: That aside, i'm going to go ahead and pull up that had come to you that I just linked.

121
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.330
Gary Schulte: So.

122
00:09:52.440 --> 00:10:05.760
Gary Schulte: I think what we can do my proposal here i'm just going to go ahead and and and start from the bottom and work my way up my my proposal is that we would token is the entire grant and the entire encumbered grant.

123
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.950
Gary Schulte: And that that token ization would.

124
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.530
Gary Schulte: be a an essence a share in the basic Dow and the base who doubt would be a.

125
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:26.010
Gary Schulte: Ideally it's going to be an autonomous TAO that can carry out the will of votes, without any.

126
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:32.880
Gary Schulte: Any intervention any any manual trustee or executor necessary to make it work.

127
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:45.300
Gary Schulte: But basically, if we token is the entire grant all of the future awards would be token, as well as well as transaction fees would go to the same base who doubt contract that would.

128
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.910
Gary Schulte: Probably on a on a semi.

129
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:58.470
Gary Schulte: monthly basis would token is its treasury, that is not encumbered as well with a fixed peg to a theorem and then the.

130
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:12.360
Gary Schulte: that the basic tokens, so to speak, would be voting shares in the Dow and then that is pretty much as far as I wanted to get with it because I think that there's a lot of.

131
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:21.510
Gary Schulte: A lot of moving parts that need to be sorted out and some consensus needs to be generated about what what the program how the program perform and what we would expect of it.

132
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:33.510
Gary Schulte: But I think that, in terms of our ability to be fair and equitable if we were able to to organize the entire encumbered grant as well as all future rewards, then we can fairly and equitably distribute.

133
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:42.840
Gary Schulte: These funds in a retroactive fashion, as we see fit right that's that's come up with political consensus about that how we want to.

134
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:49.740
Gary Schulte: reserve and set aside some of this encumbered grid to account for the work that's gone into basic to get basic to the point where it can.

135
00:11:50.460 --> 00:12:02.700
Gary Schulte: contribute and merge consensus, you know just the fact that it exists means that there are a lot of work was done long in advance to to enable us to pivot to do.

136
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.530
Gary Schulte: The merge consensus so i'm just go to the bullet points.

137
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:15.600
Justin Florentine: Before we.

138
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.910
Justin Florentine: Before we start with that Dan has got his hand up.

139
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.250
Gary Schulte: Oh yeah go ahead, sorry i'm, on the other, window, so I don't see it.

140
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.420
Gary Schulte: Go ahead and we're gonna do.

141
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.380
Justin Florentine: That yeah.

142
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.360
Danno Ferrin: yeah I did a quick read through this and there's.

143
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.510
Danno Ferrin: two very important things that I don't think are addressed here.

144
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.400
Danno Ferrin: One who runs the.

145
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.040
Danno Ferrin: notes I don't think there's consensus on that yet.

146
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.120
Danno Ferrin: Okay, and the second one is, I have a concern about.

147
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:41.010
Danno Ferrin: A simple steak What if someone has a supermajority.

148
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.540
Danno Ferrin: If someone has a super majority in a doubt they control it, it can destroy it.

149
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.630
Danno Ferrin: So, as far as the voting stuff I don't think a straight.

150
00:12:49.080 --> 00:13:06.210
Danno Ferrin: Majority rules, though, is going to work and third minor point is i'm not sure we should be looking backwards, I think we should be looking entirely forward because it's a forward looking incentive so that's that's a third minor point but that's less important than the first two.

151
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.350
Gary Schulte: I think that's fair, I mean I don't have any problems with that, I think, though, that.

152
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:29.190
Gary Schulte: I think it would be equitable to to recognize the contributions of basic contributors to make us able to participate, to begin with, but you know that's not it's not anything that I feel incredibly firmly about because i'm not in that crowd I think I mean you know it's it's.

153
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.520
Gary Schulte: I don't have it, I don't have a dog in that fight, so to speak.

154
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:42.480
Gary Schulte: it's interesting that you're you are talking about running the nodes themselves also the quadrant I think we could do quadratic voting on a doubt I don't I don't see any problem with that I don't think a supermajority yeah.

155
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.750
Gary Schulte: I think we can get around that pretty easily with with pretty well.

156
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.480
Gary Schulte: trodden ground with quadratic voting.

157
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:57.480
Rai: is then consensus considered like of consensus had some of the tokens, for example, and they considered one entity, even if they have even if they like employ.

158
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:07.740
Rai: Multiple developers to work on basal like it's not exactly because voting is a little bit more difficult when you consider like a corporate entity.

159
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:09.870
Gary Schulte: Right.

160
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.270
Rai: Because it might be the opinions are multiple people.

161
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.160
Gary Schulte: I think I would i'd like to like just talk about the technical.

162
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.520
Gary Schulte: aspect of the proposal first and then we can try to.

163
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.850
Gary Schulte: arrive at a political will, you know just.

164
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.610
Gary Schulte: Just the logistics of it i'd kind of like to go through gracie handle.

165
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.780
Grace Hartley: If you're going to address this i'll ask the.

166
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.870
Grace Hartley: dumb question and i'm sure everyone else has the answer to what is quadratic voting.

167
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:35.880
Gary Schulte: um.

168
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:36.360
Grace Hartley: What is that.

169
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:42.090
Gary Schulte: yeah quadratic voting is it's not gosh I don't have a good high level definition.

170
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.560
Of a quadratic moodle for.

171
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:53.160
Rai: Do it so basically it's a voting system, where each subsequent vote by you know the same entity, like me, for example.

172
00:14:54.090 --> 00:15:03.660
Rai: requires an increasing number of let's say like you know vote point to carry out so that way it doesn't scale linearly but it gets more and more difficult for me to have an.

173
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:10.140
Rai: More incremental influence over the vote, and what that does is that it kind of causes this balance, where.

174
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:28.110
Rai: You know all else equal you would want more broad participation by many people because their first first votes are relatively cheap to cast then like you know, having one person who you know really say having fewer people that agree on something that can vote more.

175
00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:45.630
Gary Schulte: yeah get coin matching grants are a great example in the wild of doing quadratic voting were your initial initial votes, so to speak, have have more more more weight and the more votes cast on a particular item, the less value that actually adds to your overall vote tally.

176
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.040
Gary Schulte: To go so super majority of issues.

177
00:15:52.860 --> 00:16:01.590
Danno Ferrin: But it's still possible for one entity to have enough votes that literally everyone else belts against the proposal and that one is the votes for it and it still carries.

178
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:13.050
Gary Schulte: I think it would depend on the on the the quadratic formula specifically I would probably do some looking into what get coins has done with their matching rounds.

179
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.330
Rai: Because if it is possible.

180
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.190
Rai: yeah it's.

181
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:24.150
Gary Schulte: It has to that kind of massive supermajority that I mean you really have to have like 99.9% of all the votes to really.

182
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.910
Gary Schulte: be able to silence everybody else.

183
00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.630
Gary Schulte: I mean it depends on the math but.

184
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.210
Justin Florentine: Okay.

185
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.150
Danno Ferrin: So let's move on from voting and, like the other technical points.

186
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:51.390
Gary Schulte: yeah The other point being running validator nodes I kind of had presumed to from the from our call last time I didn't look terribly close into the notion of doing.

187
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:59.100
Gary Schulte: More than a single entity we're running validator stakes, because it didn't seem like on the last call that there was interest in doing that.

188
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:07.980
Gary Schulte: We can we can go ahead and we can talk about that as as an option as well, I think there's there's definitely ways that we could do that there's a little bit of.

189
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:16.080
Gary Schulte: Coordination that needs to happen with validator keys because there's some some risk involved there.

190
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:28.410
Gary Schulte: In terms of you know you need to make sure that you're doing a good job you don't get slashed there's no surround votes all that different stuff and becomes a little more difficult when you have multiple entities that are validating we could potentially step on each other's toes and.

191
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:45.750
Gary Schulte: That could be a problem if that's something that we want to do, though, that's we can definitely sort that out there's there's lots of examples of ways that we can we can do multiple entities validating this entire set of keys an easy way to do that would be to to break it up into trenches.

192
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.330
Gary Schulte: I think there's nine.

193
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:59.940
Gary Schulte: Nine blocks of 16 is how we had approached this to to run validators just across different EC two instances, so to speak, or different different nodes.

194
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:10.290
Gary Schulte: So it would make a logical partition just it would be handy to break things up into 16 validator chunks if we wanted to have multiple entities doing this.

195
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:18.330
Justin Florentine: So before we go down that path, though i'm unclear as to whether or not he is interested in that.

196
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:33.780
Justin Florentine: Like I think that's kind of a question that we really have to make sure that they're willing to you know spread those validator keys around or if they really intending one entity to manage the whole thing I don't see why they'd have a problem with it, but.

197
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:42.630
Gary Schulte: I think the issue is coordination because they want to communicate those keys to a single entity, rather than like sharing it amongst a collection of people.

198
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.390
Gary Schulte: I think that I think that would be a coordination point.

199
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.160
Gary Schulte: we'd have to sort out.

200
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:57.990
Danno Ferrin: Okay, so I mean consensus had four months to review this before going public with it, you know why not spend time seeing of hyper ledger could be the one that could hold that validators and run them.

201
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.370
Gary Schulte: I don't know where four months came from, we definitely have not had four months to look at this.

202
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.410
Danno Ferrin: I heard that they were talking with them so geeta for four months before this month public.

203
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.990
Gary Schulte: can look back and see when when I first heard about it, I think I first heard about it.

204
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:18.270
Danno Ferrin: We need at least more than you know, four days before Christmas break to fully evaluate it.

205
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.780
Danno Ferrin: yeah whether it's a few weeks or whatever.

206
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:30.990
Danno Ferrin: yeah um so so I did ask the hyper ledger staff, if this was even a remote possibility and nobody's around that.

207
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:32.040
Danno Ferrin: That you.

208
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.660
Danno Ferrin: Get the answers from to get it from.

209
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.630
Danno Ferrin: So I think that is one thing we should consider is.

210
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:44.100
Danno Ferrin: can't have hyper ledger run it, but we can't get that answer until people are back from Christmas break and the answer has been no Daniela has their hands up.

211
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:58.320
Daniela Barbosa: That is correct, and so we have had very quick conversations with some folks on our side, I also did have a conversation with him on Monday, David boswell and I had a call with Timothy.

212
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:05.610
Daniela Barbosa: On Monday night before he started traveling and moving around and to answer your question and I won't put you know.

213
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:17.220
Daniela Barbosa: Work words in tim's mouth justin but they they would be interested in in figuring this out, but to gary's point it's really you know.

214
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:27.960
Daniela Barbosa: I think what he called it was I mean look at my notes here it's you know, accountability and you know, there has to be a central point of it so i've i've already.

215
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:42.060
Daniela Barbosa: yeah so next week, I do have a call with our Linux foundation legal team, this is, you know, obviously this is an investment cause, you know issue and i'm very interested in understanding the cost of running these nodes.

216
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:56.550
Daniela Barbosa: which was on the agenda today as well, so that we have some data that I can go back and talk about it with legal first and then obviously this is also a discussion, probably for my Governing Board for the hyper ledger foundation Governing Board immediately after.

217
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:05.040
Gary Schulte: Yes, yeah interestingly, and I don't want to make this to tactical or logistical but.

218
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:14.580
Gary Schulte: The longer that we take to to do this there's that much time that you know we're basically missing out on the validation rewards and.

219
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.680
Gary Schulte: pushing the timeline a little further out i'm wondering what take a room temperature on.

220
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:33.180
Gary Schulte: proceeding with infrastructure that consensus has in place to start the program and then with the expectation that as we designed the program we can disseminate these validator.

221
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.870
Gary Schulte: keys to validators who want to participate.

222
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:38.400
Gary Schulte: and

223
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.980
Rai: we're talking about we're talking about who's going to run the validators right.

224
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.200
Rai: Yes, so maybe harebrained idea but hear me out.

225
00:21:47.700 --> 00:22:00.270
Rai: So typically like these decentralized staking protocols are used primarily when you don't have 30 to eat steak but, in a sense, they can also be used as a staking as a service So what if we exited.

226
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:08.280
Rai: The What if we had one entity, you know, whoever we delegate to they have to validate the biggest value piece on the E, F.

227
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:19.470
Rai: You know their job is simply to and the Dow can decide who misses on each validator like each i'll do it gets a lot to essentially exit that and then re enter the queue.

228
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:36.090
Rai: or exit that and then with the East just actually put that in rocket fuel, and so it gets entered by something that you know they trust, and we can choose which thinking protocol, we trust, but that way we kind of abstract away and don't need to deal with the running of the nodes ourselves.

229
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:44.490
Gary Schulte: Well, the point, the point of the grant is to run the nodes ourselves they don't want to just say hey here's some money it's like they want to have must have some skin in the game.

230
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:51.030
Gary Schulte: We need to run our client, we need a basic needs to be the execution engine, they want to incentivize a variety of consensus engines.

231
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:51.300
Rai: Right.

232
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:59.130
Gary Schulte: And it isn't really just about you know how can we equitably share a grant this is about, proving that basically was a solid execution engine post merge.

233
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:14.490
Gary Schulte: Secondly, I think I don't want to involve I personally don't want to involve rocket pool I did consider like you know, maybe rocket fuel can be part of the solution, but I mean they're they're token omics in the bond, you have to buy with our PL and then this the just.

234
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.120
Rai: yeah it was this.

235
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.860
Rai: Gal I haven't looked into it.

236
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.060
Gary Schulte: yeah but yeah yeah.

237
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:24.630
Gary Schulte: it's it's it's cool I appreciate the work, but I don't think that we want to encumber this with that.

238
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.610
Danno Ferrin: The answer Daniela point what's the ballpark for what it takes to run a node.

239
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.110
i'm.

240
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.170
Gary Schulte: Pre merge it doesn't take a whole lot.

241
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:45.600
Gary Schulte: I mean you could do it on a graph on instance, you know, an arm 60, for instance, if it's not it does not take a lot it's the consensus portion of the node is what.

242
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:57.690
Gary Schulte: is probably what would start getting more expensive post merge, but right now largely you can run a consensus node on the same specs you can run a main net base who note on which is.

243
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:04.590
Gary Schulte: justin Do you remember what we're doing for the an easy to instance for that it's basically for cpu.

244
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.420
Justin Florentine: don't look it up.

245
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.930
Gary Schulte: yeah I think I think we're running three excel.

246
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:11.790
Danno Ferrin: three.

247
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.730
Gary Schulte: Not three excel excel running an excel.

248
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.860
Danno Ferrin: That sounds like a single alexa.

249
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.210
Gary Schulte: yeah I believe so.

250
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.030
Danno Ferrin: And that's with envy me.

251
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.590
Gary Schulte: Yes, there.

252
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.140
Danno Ferrin: Are there any other expenses options, we need to turn on into it.

253
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.410
Gary Schulte: No, not that i'm aware of no.

254
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.600
Danno Ferrin: Because you leave you'll need about a terabyte to two.

255
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.630
Danno Ferrin: terabytes of envy me data right.

256
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:35.010
Gary Schulte: yeah yeah.

257
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:40.710
Danno Ferrin: And how much data goes through, based on you know.

258
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.890
Danno Ferrin: Historical values what's the data load.

259
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:53.070
Gary Schulte: based on historical vice, I mean we'd have we'd have to look at your phone I wasn't thinking that we were going to be dead dead and it wasn't prepared for the call to be about disseminating you know.

260
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.890
Gary Schulte: validate or responsibility so.

261
00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.190
Danno Ferrin: i'm not roster runny nose, was the first point on the incentive Program.

262
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.650
Gary Schulte: yeah I didn't write down sorry.

263
00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.290
Grace Hartley: And we end up going.

264
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:08.070
For.

265
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.770
Grace Hartley: That Okay, I know I think.

266
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.680
Grace Hartley: The so a couple questions I think one, I think we did.

267
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.060
Grace Hartley: You know, you can come back to that you know it's Christmas so.

268
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:31.200
Grace Hartley: A lot of people have been off, but I think and it's makes sense, I think one point you made Gary, I just wanted to clarify is what it takes to run a note pre marriage is easier than post merge.

269
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.870
Grace Hartley: But, would we as a Community, want to consider someone who only wants to run a pre merge, just to be clear.

270
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:43.500
Gary Schulte: yeah I think I think it's just kind of an artifact of where we are in a theorem that we would be running these nodes.

271
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:49.830
Gary Schulte: Pretty merge, because the point of the program is to do post merge support because basically as an execution client.

272
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:58.140
Gary Schulte: Is what what we're what the grant is about and basis, not being used as an execution client pre merge it's only post merge it just happens to be you know.

273
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:13.920
Gary Schulte: happens to be an eighth one node that the beacon beacon chain can use for for information on deposit contracts and so forth, so it's really not a part, not much of a part of the consensus currently it's only really only going to become.

274
00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.640
Gary Schulte: More involved that interaction between the consensus and execution clients really only going to start to.

275
00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.630
Gary Schulte: exist, so to speak, post merge.

276
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.390
Grace Hartley: So.

277
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:40.530
Grace Hartley: Sorry i'm not sure I follow, so it makes sense that it's testing the two, and then the post merge and that's and basically been execution client that that all makes sense sorry i'm being a little slow.

278
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.810
Grace Hartley: And I think seven it but.

279
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:55.620
Grace Hartley: So are we saying we'd be okay, with an organization running just a node pre merge and getting.

280
00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:01.680
Grace Hartley: So let's say hyper ledger says we can't do the post merge because of X y&z you know, whatever just you know.

281
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:07.890
Gary Schulte: yeah merges postcard just table stakes, I think, if you can't post merge you shouldn't bother.

282
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.140
Grace Hartley: it's not worth it, yes that's what I yeah.

283
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.930
Grace Hartley: Like i'm like if we're just to be clear that's not.

284
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:15.930
Grace Hartley: You know, we want.

285
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:23.280
Grace Hartley: Whoever it is to be able to do both that like, and I think that's a good decision for this group to make that.

286
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.840
Grace Hartley: Does that make sense to everyone, I just wanted to clarify that because I was not 100%.

287
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.250
Gary Schulte: agree.

288
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.130
Danno Ferrin: If you're gonna run a note, it should be long term, I agree with that sentiment.

289
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.350
Danno Ferrin: Okay i'm just gonna.

290
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.340
Grace Hartley: Put that down and then decision just I guess to logistics just.

291
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:45.600
Grace Hartley: We I am taking notes in the wiki page and get some stuff so we'll share that with afterwards.

292
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.520
Grace Hartley: I think that was my only other question it looks like devin has his hand up go ahead Devon.

293
00:27:51.360 --> 00:28:06.900
Devon Artis: hey guys I door is my first time here i'm questions Preston from running a validated know what each person or entity, who runs about the data know needs to 32 feet, plus the cost of running the validated or.

294
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:23.400
Gary Schulte: The 32 meters being supplied by the ef, I think, though, I think we should have I personally think that there should be some something at stake for whoever wants to run a validator node just so that that it's not.

295
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.860
Gary Schulte: Just so that there's an additional incentive to.

296
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:37.590
Gary Schulte: To do a good job of validating and not just show up and be like a yeah sorry I let the let the note down into got slashed or whatever you know.

297
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:48.300
Gary Schulte: I think that it would be wise to have some additional bond of some sort to ensure that whomever is whomever are validators are have something at stake okay.

298
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.770
Devon Artis: Is there a point of how much they would have it had to have it state.

299
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.750
Gary Schulte: I don't know that's just that's my opinion right now we haven't really arrived at that yet.

300
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.310
Gary Schulte: meet your needs will either.

301
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:06.240
Rai: You don't need to add the complexity of separate bond you could also just security against future earnings.

302
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.840
Gary Schulte: mean it is implicitly security guess.

303
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.200
Like.

304
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.590
Gary Schulte: yeah I mean that's that will be an interesting.

305
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:26.910
Gary Schulte: An interesting mechanism to use if there was a like a genesis distribution of this basic theoretical basis token that represents the encumbered grant that would be the easiest way to.

306
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:31.680
Gary Schulte: tap something at stake, you know what your steak is is your your token.

307
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:41.100
Gary Schulte: encumbered steak So if you do a bad job and you get slashed what actually gets slashed is your your ownership of those basic tokens, so to speak.

308
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:52.140
Gary Schulte: is maintained just straight up you make make a one to one peg between basic token and whatever the encumbered eighth is now that might be a strong enough incentive, a strong enough.

309
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:59.130
Gary Schulte: skin in the game, so to speak, to make sure that validators are doing a good job, since it's no longer theoretical at that point.

310
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.080
Devon Artis: Right, thank you.

311
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:08.490
Gary Schulte: I think.

312
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:27.150
Gary Schulte: justin put T three XL and I believe the him to we're using him to storage right now and we end up with the amount of storage we allocate we end up with the highest number of I OPS that that storage class can use if that'll help with costing.

313
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.170
Justin Florentine: yeah I was looking at a may not full node and that was eight terabytes.

314
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:41.700
Gary Schulte: yeah and we can certainly get by with less storage, especially if we are using bonds I.

315
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:51.000
Gary Schulte: which I think that's kind of one of the use cases we're hoping to support post merge is lightweight storage.

316
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.840
Gary Schulte: For an execution client so.

317
00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.530
Gary Schulte: bonds, I note would presumably use a lot less.

318
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.030
Gary Schulte: storage space and I OPS.

319
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.520
Justin Florentine: yeah this this particular one that i'm looking at, for me, that is 16,000 our House.

320
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.160
Gary Schulte: What do you have creams mean that bonds I don't.

321
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.660
Justin Florentine: know, but I can find inner.

322
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.690
Gary Schulte: Peace, you have your grace, you have your hand up because.

323
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:34.590
Grace Hartley: yeah I think the white guys are looking at kind of what I think just will take the action of coming back and putting together the detailed requirements for running a note and just an pre and post merger, we can just get that in a document does that sound all right.

324
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.720
Grace Hartley: Just because I.

325
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:43.440
Grace Hartley: Know that's important to the Group and then, but one thing I think we haven't just wanting to addresses you know it.

326
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:57.660
Grace Hartley: felt like so there's obviously lots of hardware requirements there's you know technical requirements we haven't talked about expertise of the team and the person running it let's say and there's I mean I and just to be explicit.

327
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:05.820
Grace Hartley: Like I couldn't run about it or note that would be bad you know, but so, but so when we're looking at the requirements it shouldn't just be.

328
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:10.470
Grace Hartley: There should be a technical element of course and there's requirements just you know, but it also should be.

329
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:24.540
Grace Hartley: What is the skill level or what are the expertise of the person or people running it organizations running it that should they should have as well, I just don't think we've said that explicitly just yet, and I just wanted to be clear that everyone was on the same page with that as well.

330
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:31.440
Gary Schulte: it's a really good point I mean somebody yeah that's a very good point the, this is not.

331
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:41.670
Grace Hartley: There is knowledge like we can come together and work with it, with everyone to and say you know we would expect the proof people were running it to have this type of experience with.

332
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:52.620
Grace Hartley: This you know you know, whatever their skill set is just because that's you know, obviously just a huge part of it to have just you know people being knowledgeable writing it too.

333
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.250
Grace Hartley: So just want to.

334
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:54.270
Grace Hartley: Make sure that's really clear.

335
00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.910
Grace Hartley: Just you know set up the.

336
00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:00.180
Grace Hartley: Computer and have certain hardware and then you know.

337
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.640
Grace Hartley: baseline level that would be.

338
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:07.530
Gary Schulte: Reading yeah there's there's there's a lot of activities that need yeah.

339
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.190
Gary Schulte: yeah forks and things that need to be.

340
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.590
Gary Schulte: The care and feeding that need to happen.

341
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:22.170
Grace Hartley: Yes, yes, I just want to be explicit about that too, because we just had just mentioned that okay yeah, but we can take that away and.

342
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.980
Grace Hartley: But just want to make sure that was clear looks like.

343
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:32.760
Grace Hartley: And then I know we wanted to kind of get to basic Community kind of just discussion generally.

344
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.060
Grace Hartley: So what i'm.

345
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:42.180
Grace Hartley: So I do we want to continue this conversation, or do we want to.

346
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:49.290
Grace Hartley: I guess maybe we'll wrap it up what Devon answer his question and then we'll see what other items are put that we can can move on.

347
00:33:49.830 --> 00:34:01.740
Devon Artis: i'm just picking up on what you were saying about it because that's another cost i'm now i'm running about data know either the person if they're putting a stake in top of paying for the.

348
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:15.990
Devon Artis: hardware in the cloud you still need that expertise to run the know which would either be you have to know how to do itself or you have to pay a system admin who actually have experienced the blockchain validated nodes.

349
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.020
Devon Artis: So that's a big point.

350
00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:24.750
Gary Schulte: yeah I think that's fair.

351
00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:32.460
Gary Schulte: last thing I want to say i've got my hand up just because i'm going to like see conversation flow back to grace.

352
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:39.000
Gary Schulte: The one thing I want to point out is that the the perfect is going to be the enemy of the good here if we.

353
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:46.980
Gary Schulte: spend all of our time coming up with a structure and and Dow and smart contracts and.

354
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:55.590
Gary Schulte: autonomous execution and all of this stuff it's going to be well into 2022 before we're even able to start doing this, so I think that we should probably approach this from.

355
00:34:55.950 --> 00:35:08.970
Gary Schulte: An mvp perspective that minimizes trust as much as possible, but still leaves us the ability to implement a dial in a timely fashion that's audited and safe and.

356
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:16.080
Gary Schulte: Just basically safeguards the the stake for for future rewards and future.

357
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.250
Gary Schulte: incentivizing of development of basic.

358
00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.280
Grace Hartley: cool.

359
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.760
Grace Hartley: looks like we so we have kind of some next steps into and go ahead, sorry for.

360
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:37.950
Antoine Toulme: yeah.

361
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.900
Antoine Toulme: At this point I don't feel particularly good instrument for this.

362
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.750
Antoine Toulme: hyper ledger business is a project of the hyper ledger foundation.

363
00:35:50.520 --> 00:36:01.050
Antoine Toulme: And coming to ship to have been too busy with want to be based on contribution so projects if we start having monetary incentives tied to your computer ships can start to feel weird.

364
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:15.570
Antoine Toulme: There are two things that people should consider one is to refuse this money and get back to working so that we can avoid distractions because this will there's a good chance this will destroy the project and it is.

365
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.340
Antoine Toulme: Just before.

366
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:29.640
Antoine Toulme: The other one is we entrust the hyper ledger foundation with this funding, because that's where it should go, because the project is the property of the hyper ledger foundation.

367
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:43.110
Antoine Toulme: And then they will disperse funds and operate the nodes as part of the operating budget as as chartered and then they can use that to reduce fees onboard new people and help the growth of the project.

368
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.360
Antoine Toulme: that's my view.

369
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:53.340
Antoine Toulme: Is it.

370
00:36:54.810 --> 00:37:02.460
Grace Hartley: yeah I think one thing I would just say is you know it only ruins it if we let it, you know, and that is fully in our control.

371
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:14.430
Grace Hartley: And I don't want to end, I think you know if we all work together, I think there's really a great way for this to be a huge success for a Su and you know, I think that if we're.

372
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.880
Grace Hartley: Going in with the mindset of this is probably going to destroy us and probably will, if that makes sense, you.

373
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.460
Antoine Toulme: know it doesn't it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense good you said I don't agree with that.

374
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.540
Antoine Toulme: Okay, I am.

375
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.920
Antoine Toulme: I agree to disagree.

376
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.950
Grace Hartley: Because I think that and that's okay that's Okay, we can agree to disagree, but I just want to be clear that I disagree with that.

377
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:44.700
Grace Hartley: But I appreciate you I do appreciate you sharing your feedback, because that is very valid.

378
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:54.390
Justin Florentine: yeah I keep I keep thinking about this and I keep referring back to the E, F and, at the end of the day, what is the F1 to do it's their program they're running it they're distributing the keys.

379
00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:03.120
Justin Florentine: They are assuming Lee putting thought into how they want this to be run, to a degree, the WHO, they are giving the keys to.

380
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:11.610
Justin Florentine: I understand that this is very open I didn't like the actual details of it, they are not being specific about so like if we talk about.

381
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:28.230
Justin Florentine: Well, maybe consensus should not have sole control over the keys, then we have to ask ef who they want the keys to go to, and you know how to operate it, so I I hear what people are saying, as far as like well hyper ledger should be running this.

382
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:41.310
Justin Florentine: Maybe I mean I don't know I mean it's it's ef wants somebody that is a organization, not an individual to operate a fleet of validators with the intense that we.

383
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:49.080
Justin Florentine: understand the clients that are running it specifically based to as a client and how to feed them and operate them over time so.

384
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:56.850
Justin Florentine: I keep coming back to you know ef saying consensus here's a bunch of keys and saying like okay well that's our starting point.

385
00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:06.750
Justin Florentine: And then, trying to drive the conversation from there, if we want to go back before that starting point that's fine, I understand that, but nobody on this call represents enough to actually do that.

386
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:12.930
Justin Florentine: So you know, maybe we just need to have another one of these calls and make sure that we have stronger representation from E, F.

387
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.250
Danno Ferrin: Maybe we should use that as a transition to Point B because we're time box eight minutes over.

388
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:36.270
Danno Ferrin: There were some concerns about being basically attended progresses me concerns and I think that is the real subtext for what's going on here, why there's concerns about who gets what keys um the fact that the ef only discussed it with consensus, before going public.

389
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:47.730
Danno Ferrin: There seems to be a subtle feeling that this is a consensus on the project and, seeing that public behavior with with the incentive program was was concerning.

390
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:54.510
Danno Ferrin: But there's other things that have been developing since i've left consensus, it seems like the number one qualification for becoming a maintainer.

391
00:39:54.930 --> 00:40:09.000
Danno Ferrin: Is employment a consensus and it's just presumed you get hired a consensus you're getting maintain ownership so that's one thing I would like to put their this concern that I have, and then the the the contributors who are not a consensus, or having a difficult time getting their PR.

392
00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:17.550
Danno Ferrin: Unless it's by people who aren't a consensus, so it seems like there's there's an insular separation between consensus and non consensus people.

393
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:26.100
Danno Ferrin: We need to tear that down, we need to get rid of it, we need to work as a full team across the project, we need to retain people who leave consensus on a project like rye.

394
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:33.090
Danno Ferrin: And Abdo that's how we get the diversity that is so very important to an open source development project.

395
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:39.000
Danno Ferrin: So you know some of these concerns were raised up earlier by antwan, but I also share them that.

396
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:46.110
Danno Ferrin: We need to make sure that we're not just it's not consensus based so it's hyper ledger base ooh and that we find ways instructors and.

397
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:51.480
Danno Ferrin: Maybe we need to add some more standards to what it means to be a maintainer to to help build maintain the Community.

398
00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:59.430
Danno Ferrin: When it comes to our standards, one thing I would like to propose is the expectation that maintain owners call into the bi weekly calls, at least once a month.

399
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:09.510
Danno Ferrin: The one appropriately their time zone there's a lot of maintenance on listed, I never see on these calls, and I think that's The least that they could do, and I think being able to talk with people face to face.

400
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:16.500
Danno Ferrin: You know as much as face to face as you give a zoom release talk to people on the phone, at the same time.

401
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:31.410
Danno Ferrin: For the project I think it's something that will help build and grow the Community as a Community, and not just as a corporate project, so I think you know, we need to look at you know expectations for what it needs to be a maintainer so i'll see the floor.

402
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.540
Grace Hartley: Gary looks like your hands up.

403
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.660
Gary Schulte: yeah I wouldn't say I think a lot of the problems that.

404
00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:54.000
Gary Schulte: denna was referring to, apart from I I see your your criticism that being hired at consensus is there's an expectation that you are going to be a maintainer that is a logistical issue that as a 31 to resolve.

405
00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:04.200
Gary Schulte: I don't know that there's i'm not aware of PR problems i'm sure there are since you're not the only one to say that, like getting reviews, I think that what we have here, though, is a communication issue.

406
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:10.950
Gary Schulte: I don't think there's any ill will, I think it's just suboptimal are we on discord are we on rocket chat are we on.

407
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:24.810
Gary Schulte: matrix how are we actually communicating and coordinating with each other, I think that's our primary problem, but for communication and I think that's the source of most of the friction, if there is perceived friction with PRS.

408
00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:33.120
Rai: yeah I think I think a lot of this would resolve itself if there were a place that people were happy to all communicate.

409
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.270
Rai: But for a long time.

410
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.670
Rai: rocky chat was like.

411
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:40.650
Rai: Putting last year I.

412
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:48.120
Grace Hartley: said.

413
00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:49.320
hey.

414
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:58.200
Antoine Toulme: Do you want to explain to me folks how you actually work on this, because it looks like the consensus, people are working on stuff but.

415
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:21.030
Antoine Toulme: There isn't that much of design or roadmap being shared in public as a bunch of issues, but some clear my you know there were times I would help and try to review stuff but I don't think it was very welcome, or was it time anything that was lacking context So how do you actually coordinate.

416
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:29.640
Gary Schulte: yeah I can speak to that, I mean largely what we've been doing what i've been doing, I should say, has been.

417
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.730
Gary Schulte: Coordinating on awkward deb's.

418
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:47.460
Gary Schulte: Where there's a lot of communication about what the revision of the various specs are for the execution client and then translating those specs into issues and then working on those issues.

419
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.510
Gary Schulte: I haven't made a lot of effort to try to.

420
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:58.800
Gary Schulte: ask for a lot of help, honestly, because our team that that I work directly with.

421
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:06.570
Gary Schulte: we're all pretty busy with a lot of different things, a lot of different issues between bonsai and snap sync and.

422
00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:13.800
Gary Schulte: Just just a lot of things going on, so I haven't really made a big effort to.

423
00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.460
Gary Schulte: To make a lot, have a lot of communication about this, mostly i've been playing catch up and i've been.

424
00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:29.880
Gary Schulte: Today i've been primarily the only one working on the merge justin's picked up a lot of slack lately juries picked up a lot of slack lately, we can certainly do a lot better job of outreach.

425
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.850
Gary Schulte: Then have some conversation about this.

426
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:38.460
Gary Schulte: I guess on rocket chat is where we would do that I can we can certainly make an effort to do that.

427
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:54.750
Gary Schulte: But we've been definitely playing catch up there's all of the other teams, all the other client teams that are on this have had more resources dedicated to it as their primary focus, whereas the merge is somewhat been a secondary focus, at least for basic.

428
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.240
Antoine Toulme: yeah that's kind of what I mean so.

429
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:05.970
Antoine Toulme: Many by understanding that six months ago, nine months ago I.

430
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:18.420
Antoine Toulme: opened the road to get to do that in as a project manager was going to help organize and manage the issues for very soon, help us get more visibility to the roadmap and.

431
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.280
Antoine Toulme: Well, it didn't happen right so.

432
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:35.490
Antoine Toulme: what's going on there, how do you actually do road mapping, why did you say to work on this net okay see PRS all of a sudden, like he shows up and we're.

433
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.310
Antoine Toulme: starting to work on snap sync.

434
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:56.430
Antoine Toulme: Why would that come up now, is it necessary for the merge what's the design and then you see a bunch of cars and they're six sequential to each other what's what's going on there, do we need to care about this is feedback even welcome.

435
00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.390
Antoine Toulme: um, how do you want to work through this.

436
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:01.470
Gary Schulte: yeah.

437
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.110
Gary Schulte: yeah definitely feedback is welcome, and I think.

438
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.830
Gary Schulte: I think a lot of the problem is that we are.

439
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:17.370
Gary Schulte: The chupacabra team at consensus who's doing basically mean that I think that we are a lot of the coordination that we're doing is.

440
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:31.860
Gary Schulte: via the eighth R amp D discord and those channels as opposed to the hyper ledger channels and I think that's something that's an oversight that we should probably need to get that sorted out.

441
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:39.570
Gary Schulte: But yeah I agree road mapping, I think, is somewhat insular as well, and perhaps we need to open open up road mapping.

442
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:41.970
Gary Schulte: Calls just.

443
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:45.690
Gary Schulte: Over zoom have it, have an additional hyper ledger contributor.

444
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.330
Gary Schulte: Road mapping meeting in addition to our hyper ledger contributor meeting.

445
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:57.030
Grace Hartley: Gary is it Okay, if I jump in.

446
00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.370
Grace Hartley: I think.

447
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:13.530
Grace Hartley: So maybe to make these little actionable like I think yeah is you know just to be clear yeah I think everyone here has worked really hard on base ooh for and the but specifically just playing catch up like.

448
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:20.520
Grace Hartley: Gary justin hearing all have joined consensus in the last six months, something like that.

449
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:28.170
Grace Hartley: So it's still getting up to speed yeah and most of the two because our team is the same so just you know.

450
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:34.770
Grace Hartley: giving them a break that i'm really proud of them that they're engaging and want to be better, and this is really, really great so just wanted to but.

451
00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:47.700
Grace Hartley: Also, just with a you know some of the historical context and things that we've done have have just been lost, which it, which is OK, you are and we can reset now, which is just fine, but just want to give them a break first heck but uh.

452
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:58.920
Grace Hartley: You know so but I was thinking, these are a couple of good ideas, so I just wanted to make some kind of get the group's pulse on so there seemed to be a couple of ideas one was.

453
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:13.410
Grace Hartley: Having you know, making kind of are not making but I guess the the quarter request is that all contributors facing maintainer has joined their respective contributor call I think that's a reasonable ask.

454
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:22.980
Grace Hartley: You know and or at least you know, having everyone on invites and you know if they can't make it, you know the regrets are sent and it's clear who's attending that day and who's not.

455
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:27.810
Grace Hartley: that's an easy I think that's reasonable and the other one is a public roadmap.

456
00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:37.200
Grace Hartley: We did used to do this, and I think we just honestly like you know, I think, frankly, Tim because the one who did it and it just never was transition properly so.

457
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:51.390
Grace Hartley: We can definitely start having updating the one on the on the wiki I believe we have a page for it, we just haven't been updated again just because it's been busy so we appreciate you guys bearing with us, but that doesn't mean we can't do it.

458
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.200
Grace Hartley: and have it be a part of the regular contributor calls on the agenda there.

459
00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.180
Grace Hartley: I think, then, the third point is.

460
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.680
Grace Hartley: So sorry i'm just taking notes, while i'm talking here so.

461
00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:07.140
Grace Hartley: The third point is.

462
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:15.780
Grace Hartley: Once again, so then just writing this down with roadmap wiki covered.

463
00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:34.350
Grace Hartley: And then the other one is around the chat and I think we i'd love to get everyone's feedback but we're obviously at the hyper ledger level trying to come up with a proposal, and I think it's clear that the beta team feels very strongly about.

464
00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:36.660
Grace Hartley: Moving everything to discord.

465
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.860
Grace Hartley: yeah I know, and I think.

466
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:53.640
Grace Hartley: I think, so the goal is, by the end of January to have a proposal and have us be able to kind of implement moving over and then so.

467
00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.350
Grace Hartley: I make no promises, because it is a tlc decision.

468
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:07.140
Grace Hartley: With some kind of drawbacks, but that is, I just wanted to address that one that i'm really hoping it'll be addressed in January pretty quickly here.

469
00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:11.730
Grace Hartley: Because I do think it's challenging when we're all in different places and.

470
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:25.830
Grace Hartley: And you know and a lot of the coordination will be so much easier for everyone to follow what's going on and not looking at five different chats in the world, but I think there's a clear obvious case for basic to move over, even if the rest of the.

471
00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.500
Grace Hartley: Projects choose not to.

472
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:49.200
Grace Hartley: But, but so I guess Those are three proposals and I just wanted to kind of does that feel like a good start, you know i'm not saying everything self today, you know, but does that feel like things that the group is willing to commit to and it's comfortable with.

473
00:50:51.090 --> 00:51:00.990
Danno Ferrin: um here's the soft proposal, maybe we should do a non business call during the non business weeks, just to hang out and get to know people, maybe not record it talk about issues.

474
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.430
Justin Florentine: I kind of love that.

475
00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.700
Gary Schulte: yeah yeah same here, especially the not recorded but that'd be fun.

476
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.650
Danno Ferrin: To stand up.

477
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:18.360
Grace Hartley: and talk.

478
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:23.340
Antoine Toulme: yeah just going back to what you were saying.

479
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.290
Antoine Toulme: grace I think discord is fine.

480
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:36.270
Antoine Toulme: At the Apache software foundation, we use email because email is not something you can revoke money for the change have admin rights over that easily.

481
00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:46.890
Antoine Toulme: And it works pretty well it's very good Italian in how much putting everybody at the very base level of communication it's a huge drawback is it's quite huge spreads.

482
00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:53.700
Antoine Toulme: But there is a thing of the pitches if it didn't happen on list it happened, and I think that's.

483
00:51:54.540 --> 00:52:06.300
Antoine Toulme: The thing we need to leave by to that she didn't happen in public comes then it's done been discussed, so the thing that I would want us to make sure of, though, is that.

484
00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:21.510
Antoine Toulme: Right now, there are stuff that's happening in public on rocket chat and we're not catching it and I don't see how this course can be marginally better than that, so I don't think it does change, we need to fix things but i'm willing to try.

485
00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.860
Danno Ferrin: i've had chats on rocket chat and not show up.

486
00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:26.640
Danno Ferrin: On my phone.

487
00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:35.580
Danno Ferrin: diego's PR didn't show up on my phone ever and i've tried refreshing and reloaded it doesn't show up on my phone, so I am willing to put some blame on rocket chat.

488
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:39.900
Okay.

489
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:45.450
Rai: I mean that it's also up to you know the consensus team.

490
00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.610
Rai: To like use that as a default.

491
00:52:49.260 --> 00:53:00.270
Rai: And then use like the internal consensus chats just for like consensus related stuff but just a matter of like Okay, is this and usable not to use as a deep off not like does it.

492
00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:05.820
Rai: doesn't actually get the bits across us, is it like pleasurable to us.

493
00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:10.320
Rai: which apparently doesn't even get the bits at all, sometimes different agenda.

494
00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:15.900
Justin Florentine: yeah.

495
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:18.270
Justin Florentine: I never mind that you guys are both right.

496
00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:28.710
Justin Florentine: Both Anton and down yeah I think I definitely see a lot of things from like we're trying to have conversations here in rocket chat and it's just not getting any uptake.

497
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:37.920
Justin Florentine: And I also have a hell of a time trying to find threads and you know did this response going to go somewhere else and etc so.

498
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:41.820
Justin Florentine: yeah i'm gonna integrate with both digress.

499
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:53.160
Danno Ferrin: We can make a lot more rooms and discord we can have a review request room, which will really help simplify that workflow so when some of those review requests and and there's pages of conversation that won't get lost.

500
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:02.400
Grace Hartley: I think, also something that would be like you know.

501
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:13.740
Grace Hartley: i'd push us to be data driven here and what's really cool right now is the analytics for basic like lf team has like this cool you know annex dashboard.

502
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:20.430
Grace Hartley: i'd love us to like look at it, maybe every so often I need to look at it more closely, but one idea I had was you know.

503
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:26.790
Grace Hartley: You know our peoples PRS been reviewed, we could look at the average time or look at all of them on the dashboard as a part of the.

504
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:33.390
Grace Hartley: contributor call like I feel like that data is pretty if it's not already in the dashboard would it be hard to do.

505
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:43.260
Grace Hartley: Or we could look at the open ones, you know yeah you might know better than I, but I was like I feel like that would be a good way to keep us honest and also be like hey is this here, is it not I don't know you know, like.

506
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:52.500
Grace Hartley: But just it and, but you know we have kind of an easy way to just won't get the information and we can leverage that but Dana what are your ideas are.

507
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:55.170
Danno Ferrin: So the time that the.

508
00:54:55.290 --> 00:55:00.360
Danno Ferrin: PR stay open is one of the metrics they put in, I know, but I was pretty excited about it because it's.

509
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:09.300
Danno Ferrin: Honestly, you know switching putting on my CSC hat that's a metric I think we should judge all projects by am that woman's when it's yeah right Jones yes, thank you right, sir.

510
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.800
Danno Ferrin: But yeah by Jones he was really excited about it.

511
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:24.480
Danno Ferrin: Because it I think it's very important Community metric you know you scratch, an itch you put it out there and it stays out there for a month and you forget about it and they come on up to review request that's a bad onboarding experience.

512
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:30.750
Danno Ferrin: And I think that's one of the hats, we need to post maintain owners, is what does it take to get users to become contributors become entertainers.

513
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:39.060
Danno Ferrin: And stuff like that I think you know, in addition to keep the current maintainer it's going to bring new maintains and get growth going on in this project, which will really help.

514
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:45.600
Danno Ferrin: and

515
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:46.200
Grace Hartley: i'll go ahead.

516
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.260
Antoine Toulme: and say completely agree.

517
00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:59.910
Antoine Toulme: i've seen other organizations such as the open telemetry project they use a specific subpopulation of github users and they actually apply.

518
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:06.870
Antoine Toulme: different path of the repository to different people so that the person is being applied to specific portion of the code this way.

519
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:14.340
Antoine Toulme: there's these two people per portion of the code that know that they're reviewing these portion of if any PR touches their.

520
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:23.400
Antoine Toulme: code they're responsible for putting this stuff and that's actually when it's interesting to the beat of the project is they don't have rights to merge.

521
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:36.900
Antoine Toulme: They get you in there there's a different role for someone who's reading to go around and do like large batches of merging just you know pretty much it's an admin function almost so that's that's the way.

522
00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:48.750
Antoine Toulme: I like what you mentioned, is one of the thing is, if you take the money from the F we're gonna get a lot of inbound going to get a lot of people being to be certainly very interested in participating in business.

523
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:54.120
Antoine Toulme: Because I get a chance for some some cash rewards at the end right so.

524
00:56:56.130 --> 00:57:06.810
Antoine Toulme: that's The thing that we might want to prepare ourselves for that maybe have better and bonnie and also better ways to to deal with in bellevue office setting some some real limits and.

525
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.930
Antoine Toulme: Better experiences a computer.

526
00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:13.110
Antoine Toulme: So you just thought.

527
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:23.010
Danno Ferrin: Oh, you mentioned code owners initially I resisted it when we were smaller project, but I think we're at the size and scope or I think it's appropriate there are things about.

528
00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:36.900
Danno Ferrin: kp FT consensus that I had no clue and no desire to learn about, but I am intimately and painfully familiar with certain parts of the vm, so I think we're getting to the point where differentiation among the maintainer is is probably a good thing.

529
00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:56.700
Gary Schulte: let's jump in real quick, I completely agree with that, I think that there's something to be said about discovery and discovery that happens as part of doing review on code you don't know so it'd be nice if there was some.

530
00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:05.430
Gary Schulte: Some mechanism there where we still have that exposure and discovery that we don't just rely on some entrenched in ossified.

531
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:11.220
Gary Schulte: handful you know shortlist of people who know only the only ones we know about give you FT.

532
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:13.290
Gary Schulte: For example.

533
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:20.310
Danno Ferrin: let's pick on a team where it's 2am at their place.

534
00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:38.940
Grace Hartley: So we only have three minutes left, so I kind of want to just wrap and make sure we have kind of the clear action item send next steps ready any.

535
00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:55.050
Grace Hartley: For the next call so just to be clear, we have a next call i'm going to look at my calendar now it's is it next week, but it's APEC friendly I believe so it's 9pm Eastern on the third on Monday okay.

536
00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:57.780
Grace Hartley: So.

537
00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:06.330
Grace Hartley: To be clear, we probably will share the notes out of the agenda out I don't think we'd have.

538
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:13.530
Grace Hartley: A couple of actions I have captured first maybe it's worth calling out come back with a detailed understanding of what it takes to run a validator note.

539
00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:22.440
Grace Hartley: To be clear, I don't think we'll have that ready for Monday so just want to set those expectations, but I think in the next week or two, we can.

540
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:32.580
Grace Hartley: Just be clear that will not be ready for Monday the next couple things is, I think it makes sense to review these ideas for improving the basic Community with.

541
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:41.580
Grace Hartley: That group just because they haven't been a part of the conversations in the last couple weeks, I want to make sure that we get their feedback, but I think we can start to implement a few of them there.

542
00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:43.650
Grace Hartley: I think.

543
00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:52.470
Grace Hartley: But I don't see any issues for that are you know no red flags, but at least get them started.

544
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:55.380
Grace Hartley: Then.

545
00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:02.940
Grace Hartley: I think those are that's it that's actually the only kind of two big items, am I missing anything anything else.

546
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.460
Gary Schulte: I was hoping to take just a couple of.

547
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.860
Gary Schulte: Quick room temperature polls.

548
01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:17.070
Gary Schulte: The first is just so that we don't invest a lot of time and effort into ideas that are unpopular.

549
01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:32.580
Gary Schulte: what's the what's the upper down on whether we think that it's wise to to try to token eyes the encumbered grants and rewards and use that as the basis of adele does that How does that How does that sit with folks just hasn't notion.

550
01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:39.330
Justin Florentine: it's an open, I know.

551
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.510
Gary Schulte: a cry from Anton.

552
01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:49.020
Justin Florentine: yeah i'm kind of like can I defer my vote to somebody that knows something about crypto economics, because.

553
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:52.080
Justin Florentine: i'm not going to have a useful opinion on this.

554
01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.890
Justin Florentine: Like I think after we have a conversation with lex or somebody somebody that can.

555
01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:04.590
Justin Florentine: Explain crypto economics and how could work in this situation, I got nothing to bring the table.

556
01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:06.000
Gary Schulte: Okay.

557
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.710
Danno Ferrin: I got one word sushi.

558
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.570
Justin Florentine: yeah.

559
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.260
Gary Schulte: yeah and I don't know exactly how you're drawing that comparison, but I certainly don't want to be compared to sushi.

560
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.190
Justin Florentine: Okay, let me.

561
01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:35.640
Danno Ferrin: Put a proposal up i'll put a proposal up myself before the end of the day, what my vision would be so.

562
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:38.130
Justin Florentine: Okay, thanks cool.

563
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.400
yeah.

564
01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.590
Gary Schulte: This is uh.

565
01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:50.160
Gary Schulte: yeah that we have some some other proposals out there cool I think that's that's really it, because if if we want to that I guess the other, the other.

566
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:59.640
Gary Schulte: temperature check is half of the client teams have already claimed their validator program rewards do we have.

567
01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:12.210
Gary Schulte: Do we think that there's it's something that we should mvp on and get involved in the program and sort out the the the trustee slash decentralized.

568
01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:25.260
Gary Schulte: nature of participating the program afterwards, and we want to have a program upfront before we accept the grant from it yeah.

569
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:45.390
Grace Hartley: I think we should give it a week or two and get a few of these ideas out and then I think it's too early to say if that makes sense, but I recognize time is of the essence and we don't want to delay too long, but I just I think it's a little too premature to get a.

570
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.610
Gary Schulte: completely.

571
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:48.390
Grace Hartley: gone there yeah.

572
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:48.870
Grace Hartley: But yeah.

573
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:50.430
Gary Schulte: I think every.

574
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:56.610
Grace Hartley: Very soon as a good goal, but just let's give it a week or two of just kind of picking out.

575
01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:03.540
Grace Hartley: cool which one is over, I apologize, I will share the notes in the chat and all that I will have.

576
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.660
Grace Hartley: And then I will share the.

577
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:21.990
Grace Hartley: The recording and all of that, I do think monday's call might be a little bit of a repeat of the last couple conversations just to catch that group up, so I don't want to like, but I do you think the following contributor call maybe we'll do another ice off cycle one.

578
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:35.280
Grace Hartley: The week of the 10th and I think that will be much more meaty but I will will will share the agendas and get that circuiting with the group so and Dana will look out for your proposal appreciate that cool thanks I appreciate it.

579
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.320
Justin Florentine: yeah.
