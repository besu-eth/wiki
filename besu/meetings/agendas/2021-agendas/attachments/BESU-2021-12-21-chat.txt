01:16:59	Danno Ferrin:	“Proposed to all teams” - it was only proposed to conensys
01:23:52	Danno Ferrin:	I’ve asked for GAR-e either to be released or abandoned for a few months now
01:24:14	Gary Schulte:	To be fair, we are recovering from a massive team restructuring.
01:25:35	Danno Ferrin:	I would like to hear Grace’s proposals before we go deeper into team dynamics
01:26:09	Tim Beiko:	Going off camera for 2 mins, still listening
01:27:32	Danno Ferrin:	It was kind of a challenge putting th quarterly report together TBH
01:29:57	Gary Schulte:	It is never too late Danno!
01:30:14	Danno Ferrin:	I’m not going back to consensus while forced arbitration is a thing
01:36:51	Gary Schulte:	I’d love for HL Besu be a model for how to handle community incentives around these grants.
01:41:09	Danno Ferrin:	Sorry for shouting that but I’ve had the external contributor discussion before.
01:41:27	Tim Beiko:	My bad, apologies
01:44:53	Tim Beiko:	Note: txn fees will be available right after the merge, so sometime in H1 of next year
01:52:50	Tim Beiko:	Daniela raised her hand for the first time
01:54:12	Tim Beiko:	I’m tim@ethereum.org for follow ups
01:54:29	Tim Beiko:	Thanks!
01:55:30	Tim Beiko:	TXN fees alone should be >>>>>>>> the cost of the nodes
01:55:35	Gary Schulte:	Does this warrant an off-cycle follow up call?
01:55:53	Tim Beiko:	Obviously not instant, but should be well above the server costs pretty quickly.
01:56:02	Danno Ferrin:	Yes.  We also need a concrete complete “red herring” proposal as well, not talking points.
