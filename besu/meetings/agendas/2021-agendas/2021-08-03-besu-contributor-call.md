**Notes:**

  

Next Release is going to be August 17th. Danno is going to merge a few PRs into Besu prior to that release, including he is doing the master to main branch change today. 

 London hard fork refactoring is slowly being updated on refactoring. 

GentleBIT has [white paper](https://gentlebit.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GEN_Blockchain_Whitepaper.pdf) they want to merge, particularly around block rewards. The fork can be seen [here](https://gitlab.gentlebit.cz/xixoio/besu/-/tree/genesis). 

They are currently at MVP stage aligned with the white paper features. They already deployed on mainnet as of August 1st.  Team needs to spend more time evaluating impacts to Besu. 

Action:

1. Jan will be able to fork it into GitHub would make it easier for us to reference or if there is a readable diff. It could be a remote option. We could then push it to a personal fork of Besu on a remote way. 
2. Grace to set up RocketChat GenChain channel to talk about this topic publicly and in more detail
