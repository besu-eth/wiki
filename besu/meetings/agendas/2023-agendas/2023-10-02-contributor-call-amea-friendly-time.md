    - No issues among maintainers - looks fine 
- **Release updates**
  - NOTE docs release [process change](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BESU/Documentation+release+process) for docusaurus - requires a PR (not just a github release)
  - 23.7.x series - trialling releasing from a release branch per - (RFC) [Reprise: Release Candidates from Main For Every Release](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BESU/Reprise%3A+Release+Candidates+from+Main+For+Every+Release)
    - (Incorporates both [Proposal: Quarterly releases from main by default](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BESU/Proposal%3A+Quarterly+releases+from+main+by+default) AND [Proposal: Avoid Cherry-Picked Releases](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BESU/Proposal%3A+Avoid+Cherry+Picked+Releases))
    - (from Simon) This did not work well for 23.7.3-RC, hopefully Gary has enough context to discuss the issues, but the main ones were:
      - Carrying out the release was complicated and error prone: cherry picking still needed to happen even though it was a release from main - it *could* be scripted BUT...
      - There's a manual part of the process where we have to work out from which commit to start the cherry-pick.
      - Discord thread: [https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/943252457063075880/1153922976736104449](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/943252457063075880/1153922976736104449)
    - NOTES ON CALL:
      - Good:
        - Can merge to main
        - Good squash/commit history
        - Can easily abort release candidates that fail and does not create candidate docker images that users may pick up by accident 
      - Bad:
        - Different SHAs for cherry picks, more fraught history
        - Need admin to disable branch protection rules for new release branches 
      - Only Gary and Simon have used this release process 
      - Human required process needs to identify which SHA commit we start the release from 
      - Need work around automation and process itself 
      - 23.10.0 -
        - Should take this into the automation realm → iterating on scripts for release automation 
      - Fabio would like to try this process on next release 
      - We will pilot this release process before making it official - perhaps in 24.1.0 
  - 23.7.3-RC release update from Ameziane - [Memory usage investigations on 23.7.3-RC](../../../../besu/performance-stability/memory-usage-investigations-on-2373-rc.md)
    - PLAN FROM CALL: 
      - Check with Danno RE required release timeline for Swirld's Labs
        - If needed within a week: cherry pick on 23.7.3 for a .4 release
        - Otherwise, include in 23.10.0 and begin burn-in on Friday after code freeze 
  - Enterprise Releases proposal - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeI2fq3jBYFyQHj4kHb1OemAzI1L6DRudkEtZRSYabM/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeI2fq3jBYFyQHj4kHb1OemAzI1L6DRudkEtZRSYabM/)  - NOTES BELOW: 
    - Starting point → Release candidate is cut and socialized with ALL contributor groups 
    - RCs can be tested within any organizations environment and with their own testing suite and then results are socialized
      - Socializing RCs for parties in the #besu-release channel 
      - Normal time-bound is Friday → Wed/Thurs of the following week 
      - Agreement on results can pause a release → This is probably where we need the most consensus among maintainers
    - Extension of acceptance tests for private / permissioned chains ?
    - Need to iron out what process may be used for private chains (Kaleido action item, perhaps) 
    - Need to ensure we are marrying up use-case distributions work discussed previously (modularity) with an interim strategy here 
    - Consider docker and kubernetes setups and other cloud environments, perhaps 
  - Defaults:
    - Snap, Bonsai, and Archive 
    - Private networks do care about these features and will need to understand what will be the impact to their networks 
- **Work Updates**
  - Cancun  
    - devnet 9 - already started, besu is contributing with a minor stake. encountering proposal problems still being debugged.
    - hive tests relevant to devnet 9 are all passing but 4, 1 of those is pending update from test authors.
- **Other Business**
  - [Proposal: Discord Server Pub/Priv Channel Split](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22156351) \- unanimous at this stage for the "besu enterprise" channel name
    - "besu-enterprise" as a great name for private/enterprise use-cases
    - Landed on two recommendations in Matt N's comment on the proposal above 
  - [\[ACCEPTED\] DEBUG Log Improvement Proposal](../../../../besu/developing-and-conventions/archive-dev/accepted-debug-log-improvement-proposal.md) - reminder about this one, looking for feedback. If no major objections will make it a policy and continue submitting PRs to make our current logging conform.
