00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.460
Ameziane Hamlat: How you everyone.

2
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.310
Justin Florentine: Good morning.

3
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.950
Diego López León: Hello! Good morning.

4
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.170
Nischal Sharma: A

5
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.830
Matt Nelson: hello, everyone.

6
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.560
Fabio Di Fabio: hey? I know

7
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.419
Matt Nelson: if I'm good

8
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.419
Matt Nelson: a good mix.

9
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.420
Matt Nelson: Give it a few minutes I get started.

10
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.079
Matt Nelson: I will share the link to the agenda here.

11
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.280
Matt Nelson: There's anything that you want to discuss that is not on the agenda. Totally okay.

12
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.520
Matt Nelson: it's a little bit of a rehash from last time and

13
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.130
Matt Nelson: some other things.

14
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.220
Matt Nelson: Alright, it's 5 after

15
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.280
Matt Nelson: we can go through the agenda. I'm just gonna share my screen for the sake of the reporting.

16
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.199
Matt Nelson: can folks read this by chance?

17
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.750
Fabio Di Fabio: Yeah, they

18
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.830
Matt Nelson: too small. I'm gonna call it big enough. Okay, as usual.

19
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.660
Matt Nelson: There's antitrust notice or recording the meeting.

20
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.690
Matt Nelson: and if you have questions you can use the hand, raise feature, or you can just come off mute. I don't think

21
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:52.590
Matt Nelson: we're gonna have issues talking over each other today. for announcements. I submitted the Q 2 reports for Hyper Ledger Base. So if you're interested in reading that report.

22
00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:04.910
Matt Nelson: you can. It's here. The kind of key points that they look to pull out are contributor activity, new contributor. Diversity, health of the project, direction of the project. All that good stuff.

23
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.000
Matt Nelson: so If you're interested in that check it out. there's

24
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.129
Matt Nelson: more kind of forthcoming information around. Kind of what's next for second half.

25
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:27.139
Matt Nelson: at least from the Consensus Maintainer. So stay tuned. When I have more of those I'll share. I think it's gonna be this week what kind of our roadmap view looks like coming up.

26
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.139
Matt Nelson: so definitely want folks input. And ideas. And if there's anything that you

27
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:43.970
Matt Nelson: are interested in working on, or if you see that's missing from the roadmap again, this is just our view of the roadmap. it's a collaborative process, let me know. And we can kind of let's see what that looks like.

28
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.269
Matt Nelson: Well, yeah. Q. 2 reports here. I don't know why this got invented

29
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.160
Matt Nelson: So check that out

30
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.510
Matt Nelson: on release updates. we had

31
00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:19.069
Matt Nelson: little bit of a snapping with 23 dot 4 dot 3. So we had kind of scrubbed that release and followed it down with 23 dot port up for. So the this was primarily a bug fixed point release on top of what we already have, with some fixes for the transaction pool. some other items around Sync and Bonzi and our PC, so nice big bug fix releases

32
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.220
Matt Nelson: and upcoming, we have 23.7.so our July quarterly release.

33
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:34.989
Matt Nelson: we are discussing, but not necessarily have any strong opinions about setting some new defaults alongside our deprecation items.

34
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.660
Matt Nelson: so let's chat about these really quickly.

35
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:47.530
Matt Nelson: We're thinking about making the new layer transaction pool the default for maintenance. I can let Fabio discuss, maybe the results of the test and the bug fixes.

36
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.910
Fabio Di Fabio: Yes. so

37
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.910
Fabio Di Fabio: then you like. Our transaction pool is now running since

38
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.679
Fabio Di Fabio: months on our production

39
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.760
Fabio Di Fabio: money that works and it's doing it fine.

40
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.840
Fabio Di Fabio:  Also, there

41
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.149
Fabio Di Fabio: are some just one

42
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:25.149
Fabio Di Fabio: you should that I have found since now that was enabling the layer at transaction pool on a new note.

43
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:39.450
Fabio Di Fabio: retard, not an error. and this is fixed so it should be fine for the new

44
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.160
Fabio Di Fabio: This also address some of the potential

45
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.640
Fabio Di Fabio: a box

46
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:58.409
Fabio Di Fabio: on the transaction pool. So it's what to I'm making the by your transaction for the the default, and the keeping the

47
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.270
Fabio Di Fabio: the old one

48
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.360
Fabio Di Fabio: as

49
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.280
Fabio Di Fabio: that can be enabled by a properties. So in case of something.

50
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.359
Fabio Di Fabio: that is how? No, at the moment

51
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:21.489
Fabio Di Fabio:  some issue that no, no, we can always use the option to.

52
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:35.010
Fabio Di Fabio: He was one. but I said, we are running this since at least a couple of months on not many different, but it that, or instances also production, without having

53
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.929
Fabio Di Fabio: any any issue. And.

54
00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:48.460
Fabio Di Fabio: as I said, probably in a previous  the comparison.

55
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:57.379
Fabio Di Fabio: we the and they the existing and a transaction pull is better in any matrix. So

56
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.629
Fabio Di Fabio: it also, creates better

57
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.279
Fabio Di Fabio: and the block with more value

58
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.770
Fabio Di Fabio: compared to those one.

59
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.490
Fabio Di Fabio:  yeah, we got.

60
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.619
Fabio Di Fabio: Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead, Bobby.

61
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:22.200
Fabio Di Fabio: So for this I'm in. I propose to make this the the fourth on the new.

62
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.350
Matt Nelson: Have we had any bunny testing this

63
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:46.980
Matthew Whitehead: around private networks? I know there was some flags that need to be set in order to deal with future. Not stuff. Yeah. The this is my, how that? yeah. So we? We've been running with the new lead pool in some of our performance tests.

64
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:57.850
Matthew Whitehead: We did have to set the we had to increase the default maximum number of transactions per sender from the default. 200. But but once we did that

65
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:11.789
Matthew Whitehead: it was behaving fine. It was stable, and I want to increase that number. The performance was exactly as we had had before we turned on the new pool. So we've been exercising a bit as probably any for a week or 2.

66
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.439
Matthew Whitehead: yeah. So that that's the amount that we've given there. Given it a a trial

67
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:32.899
Matthew Whitehead: that's good, though at least to note that it doesn't impact private networks too much without making note of that flag. So what did you have to bump that value to from 200. well, I went from 200 to 500.

68
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:43.719
Matthew Whitehead: I I we we didn't spend ages sort of binary shopping to to see at which point, we we found a sweet spot. But

69
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:53.429
Matthew Whitehead: I it. Putting it to 500, meant, I think, the bottleneck was back in article, because we we've been exercising our own sort of platform.

70
00:10:53.450 --> 00:11:08.430
Matthew Whitehead: and I think for 500 min it was back in our call in terms of where the bottlenecks were. 200 was definitely like not maybe a quarter of our performance. We all. Obviously this was all. With a single sender in our performance. Test.

71
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.130
Matthew Whitehead: I think

72
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:22.890
Matthew Whitehead: the for we had with the previous pool. If I like, you have to do a bit math to work it out. I think maybe it's 400 on the previous pull. When you set the maximum Tx percent to point

73
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.040
Matthew Whitehead: one.

74
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:49.389
Fabio Di Fabio: Yeah. So my guess is, 400 would probably have been fine as well. There is no issue in and the catalog rising. This value actually, this is there not for performance, but for the possibility to mitigate some kind of facts on maintenance, so

75
00:11:49.390 --> 00:12:00.240
Fabio Di Fabio: on. Product mentor. If there is enough trust between the peers, it's fine to to rise this even to higher value.

76
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:16.399
Fabio Di Fabio: I'm thinking of also changing this this fault when other mitigation I've been implemented, we'd be implemented in the future. So this could be actually a

77
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:29.010
Fabio Di Fabio: higher value. When we are we? We trust that some kind of a tax not possible, for

78
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:49.139
Matthew Whitehead: we need to avoid

79
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.840
Fabio Di Fabio: having this limit for local transaction. So

80
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.660
Fabio Di Fabio: local transaction

81
00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:02.509
Fabio Di Fabio: could fill the pool without any issue.

82
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.349
Fabio Di Fabio: because you.

83
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.530
Fabio Di Fabio: basically, you should trust not

84
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.230
Fabio Di Fabio: from section centers.

85
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:19.329
Fabio Di Fabio: so this this is my feature that we can add, and this will

86
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:34.280
Fabio Di Fabio: say, remove all the issue we had with private network user reporting that the transaction pool is dropping some of the

87
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.680
Fabio Di Fabio: locally sent.

88
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:53.919
Matthew Whitehead: Yeah, I I could certainly see an argument for some sort of something between those where where you might still want to to sort of limit the pool size for local transactions. But you might want a different limit for for remote.

89
00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:13.889
Matthew Whitehead: because even with the local node you might still have multiple senders. So, leaving it completely limitless for them to fill the transaction pool might might still be problematic, but having 2 different numbers to tune which still would give you back a bit of control for the the local and remote cases.

90
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.829
Fabio Di Fabio: Okay? Good point. yeah. I think it's definitely possible to

91
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:30.989
Fabio Di Fabio: at the flexibility of tune it local and remote limit in a different way. Yes, thanks for the suggestion.

92
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.160
Matt Nelson: Cool

93
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.920
Matt Nelson: any other comments here.

94
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:51.850
Matt Nelson: Nope, okay, let's keep moving on. The other thing we toyed with was Theonzai as a default. I think this one needs a little more.

95
00:14:52.510 --> 00:15:02.450
Matt Nelson: We need to kind of figure out what that looks like in terms of existing nodes and changing things around. but the goal is to move away from forests on main net.

96
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:24.910
Matt Nelson: so we might need a way to flexibly choose the storage format based on the names network you use, or if you use a custom, Genesis go to somewhere else. But the problem is is what you run basso by default on main net or earlier the like. You start up with full sync. Excuse me fast, Sync and Forrest, which is really bad. Ux.

97
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.879
Matt Nelson: I'm not proposing to be changes in 23 7, necessarily. But we're gonna do some exploration on the consensus

98
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:42.010
Matt Nelson: software side. where we, you know, we'll we'll kind of do some digging and see what the impacts might be, and I'll probably share some kind of document.

99
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:55.730
Matt Nelson: but I presume that if we change the default that won't matter to too much, because the folks using private networks are likely using custom configs or setting the config manually anyway. but it might cause a little bit of friction. So we're just gonna look, see what that looks like.

100
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.640
Matt Nelson: Cool.

101
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:05.769
Matt Nelson: all right. kind of the meat and potatoes part of the

102
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:13.670
Matt Nelson: the call. So no. We discussed last time the consensus mechanism, plugins and modularity

103
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:20.270
Matt Nelson: the links that I have linked here are similar to the one last time

104
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:29.040
Matt Nelson: we have the modular review. This is a  This is work that Justin had done previously

105
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.740
Matt Nelson: on the

106
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:40.170
Matt Nelson: basically what we would need to get to a more modular client that has a lot of details as far as like overview potential approaches. And whatnot

107
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:47.440
Matt Nelson: this Mirror board is what Gary and I had worked on regarding what are the components that we would need to potentially lift out

108
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.670
Matt Nelson: and the new page that I just created here

109
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.009
Matt Nelson: last week is around kind of our approach and working group.

110
00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:06.480
Matt Nelson: My suggestion is, we'll need if we want to start working on this at some point soon we will need to start a separate working group and not use these contributor calls to do this.

111
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:20.719
Matt Nelson: And again, I think our suggestion is to start with the proof of work module, just because it's the most straightforward, as far as validation rules and areas where it touches different components throughout the code base.

112
00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:26.960
Matt Nelson: Diego, you were not available for the last call where we went over these materials.

113
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:32.510
Matt Nelson:  What

114
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:46.090
Matt Nelson: the kind of overview that we did again was that we walked this mirror board. It had a list of all the components. that we think would be impacted by this kind of work. And then 2 potential approaches on how we could do it.

115
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.620
Matt Nelson: We're looking at the Plugin system

116
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:59.459
Matt Nelson: to drive a lot of this modularity work. I don't know your familiarity with that system. you know. Would you want to work on this kind of working group?

117
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:09.089
Matt Nelson: again, our our thought process is to start with proof of work, because it seems the most simple that could be a a naive approach. do you have any comments on this?

118
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:21.839
Diego López León: Well, yeah, absolutely. I think it's a great idea to start with a working group. I I didn't watch the the the videos go, but I can't do it. A job.

119
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:27.389
Diego López León: what we discussed all this. But yeah, thinking about the login system.

120
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.589
Diego López León: Okay, sounds great.

121
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:40.549
Matt Nelson: Yeah. I think that the that you can potentially skip the recording and go straight to the mirror and to this document here they we just kind of walk through them.

122
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:54.770
Matt Nelson: so yeah, I think I know. we also had interest from Matt, Whitehead and Michelle on this one. Do you guys think that starting one, a working group in the next couple of weeks. Would you be able to planned and take? You know

123
00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:01.659
Matt Nelson: we can lay out a plan. I think that there wouldn't be immediate action on pretty much anyone we would kind of like. I said.

124
00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:27.180
Matt Nelson: how we were going to do work and then use that as a template or the other consensus mechanisms. I think frankly, proof of authority will be the most difficult service. Well, yes, I certainly have availability in that sort of timeframe that. Yes, thanks. And yeah. Also like from me and George from the up to labs we working interested in getting involved in this

125
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.280
Matt Nelson: cool. So maybe I'll do I'll set something on the Hyper Ledger calendar for

126
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:43.689
Matt Nelson: maybe a week or 2 from now, just to get us coordinated. I'll also share materials on the Plugin system in general. We have a few workshops on like

127
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:55.410
Matt Nelson: how the plugins work, how to use them to extend the client and all that good stuff. It won't get us more. It'll get us kind of most of the way there. And then I think again, we can use that working or to lay out some action items.

128
00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:05.739
Matt Nelson: But I think it's just going to have to be kind of hacking away at these consensus as in us consensus software was more than happy to support this initiative.

129
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.950
Matt Nelson: but yeah, I definitely recommend reviewing these, I think one.

130
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:28.639
Matt Nelson: Well, I'll I'll something kind of closer towards the end of July will probably be better for everybody. Just knowing some timelines. Justin, is there anything you want to add from your modularity review, or the work that you did. Prior. That might be useful context going into those meetings.

131
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:50.849
Justin Florentine: You know, I'm not sure about anything in particular that needs to be covered. this is an idea that's been around for probably 2 years now, and has made some progress, but not a ton. I would encourage anybody that's interested to just start a discussion. I'm happy to participate. This is an area of interest for me.

132
00:20:50.850 --> 00:21:03.960
Justin Florentine: I did a lot of work on introducing dagger into the code base, and I think that's probably going to be Our preferred mechanism of achieving that interoperability with with the modules as we define them.

133
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:28.980
Justin Florentine: So you know, I don't know that I have anything in particular. I'm trusting that everybody here is seasoning software developers and understand what we mean by inversion of control, modularity, etc., etc. So if if those concepts we might be interpreting differently, just reach out to me, and we can. We can discuss that and make sure that we're on the same page.

134
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.040
Justin Florentine:  I think that's about it.

135
00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.440
Justin Florentine: Do you have any other question?

136
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:50.259
Diego López León: Yeah, thank you, Justin? yeah, I just want to know if you were thinking also to move proof of stake to be a part of a plugin or something like that. I mean, everything would be a plugin. I mean, the consensus is make an in every consensus mechanism will be applied.

137
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.060
Justin Florentine: Yeah. So

138
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:58.620
Justin Florentine: yeah, we're we're kind of already there, honestly, with the way the engine Api's work. you know. Proof of state

139
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:06.210
Justin Florentine: is a notion that doesn't appear a lot in the base to code base. Honestly. so

140
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:18.710
Justin Florentine: that's definitely Maybe a thing that we clean up a little bit But I don't imagine there's going to be a ton of work. And I think the engine Api is going to end up proving pretty useful to other types of consensus as well.

141
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:32.849
Matt Nelson: Yeah. And and one thing we discussed last time was basically having, like the default, be proof of stake and still ship it with the same template process that we use for the other consensus mechanisms. It's just by default. We like include the proof of stake one.

142
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:47.910
Matt Nelson: and we also include the others. But you have to kind of swap them out essentially, if that makes sense. Our goal was to make it so that all of them could kind of use the same interface but by default they are basically pointed towards proof of stake. And then we have the 3

143
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:57.530
Matt Nelson: or the 2 other kind of Plugin modules, and as you specify proof of work or proof of authority. then it just kind of plugs it in at, you know. Configuration time and at Runtime.

144
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:00.660
Diego López León: Thank you

145
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.780
Matt Nelson: awesome?

146
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:16.839
Matt Nelson: Yeah, I will. I'll I'll share an email. maybe not an email. I'll write something in the contributor channel and I'll set a a calendar invite through the hyper ledger basis

147
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.170
Matt Nelson: list

148
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:24.069
Matt Nelson: thing. So the thing that creates these calendar invites I'll set up a working group.

149
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:44.419
Matt Nelson: I'll pick an arbitrary date, or maybe I'll do some kind of poll in the discord. But I'm thinking, basically, the last week of July, if folks are around, if not, we can try to find another time. There's no tremendous rush on this. but we will. I'll try to work around people's vacations and summertime plans and whatnot. But I'll I'll I'll

150
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.660
Matt Nelson: Matt, I will share this

151
00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.630
Matt Nelson: in the

152
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.120
Matt Nelson: the contributors. Channel.

153
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.000
Matt Nelson: Awesome.

154
00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:02.969
Matt Nelson: sweet. The next one is around technical documentation quests.

155
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.630
Matt Nelson:  we don't have Dana on the call but another

156
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:19.620
Matt Nelson: kind of put out there to try to work with us on documenting the Evm library and some of those features there. We did have some recent document improvements in there. So I think we're getting started on that one which is great.

157
00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:29.959
Matt Nelson:  as we modify the plugin system I also want, or if we need to modify the plugin system. But as we use it, I want to make sure that we're documenting

158
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:49.820
Matt Nelson: pain points, challenges and kind of approach from a developer perspective. I'd like to use this exercise with the consensus mechanisms to one identify pain points with the plugins and to identify like just kind of working process. So we can kind of revitalize the docs page. So I'm gonna

159
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.829
Matt Nelson: put my name next to this, since I'll be following the

160
00:24:53.890 --> 00:25:06.180
Matt Nelson:  the working group with for consensus mechanisms. But again, the goal is to kind of have a new approach around plugins in the second half, to try to encourage folks to look at the plugins for

161
00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:17.749
Matt Nelson: client modifications, for other chains and other paradigms. Whatever we need as opposed to kind of working basis or doing some crazy stuff. But in reality, I think the thing is, we need to

162
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.590
Matt Nelson: make sure we have better documentation around that. So

163
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.569
Matt Nelson: that's part of a kind of Plugin revitalization strategy. That

164
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:32.259
Matt Nelson: isn't much of a strategy as it is. Let's start using the plugins ourselves and kind of dog fooding and then putting more detail back out into the world.

165
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.829
Matt Nelson: but but anyway, yeah, I will be

166
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:44.210
Matt Nelson: probably following up with all those folks who use the plugins to get some more notes going forward, and if you' if you have on the call.

167
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:50.129
Matt Nelson:  use these and are having questions or pain points. Maybe what I'll do is create a new.

168
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.889
Matt Nelson: a page on the base of the key where we can start to collect feedback around the plugins.

169
00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.669
Matt Nelson: that's actually a great idea.

170
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.269
Matt Nelson: Plug into some feedback and pain points

171
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.880
Matt Nelson: and details.

172
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:23.070
Matt Nelson: Again, the goal is to get more people to try to use this as as a modification point for base, as opposed to using either another client or

173
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:28.619
Matt Nelson: trying to for the code base. the try like shipping stuff.

174
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:34.809
Matt Nelson: do we? I think this might not not necessarily as premature.

175
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.410
Matt Nelson: but I think we should start to think about this as a part of our

176
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:51.450
Matt Nelson: documentation around the Plugin upgrades is what we can now do. Kind of with some of the State shipping stuff. Gary. This is more a question, not question. But this is more around you and Kareem's work. It's maybe putting some of that back in the documentation.

177
00:26:53.040 --> 00:27:01.419
Gary Schulte: Yeah, certainly. I think anytime one of the things that we should consider when we're developing plugins or or extending the Plugin Api is

178
00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:11.169
Gary Schulte: documenting specifically what we've what we've moved into the Plugin Api out of the main code base, and you know the motivation. What? What can be done with it?

179
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:28.590
Gary Schulte: and just kind of act as a a point of entry for for the Plugin. Maybe we could do that directly in the code base that defines the Plugin Api via a mark down. Or maybe we need some external repo documentation. But I one of the things that kind of stands out is that

180
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.720
Gary Schulte: We could arbitrarily move anything into the Plugin Api.

181
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.019
Gary Schulte: Then we probably have some some

182
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:49.530
Gary Schulte: design goals and documentation around that, so that we can all be on the same page about what needs to be in the Plugin, and what the Api could look like that way. This doesn't end up like a kind of a random collection of interfaces. We wanted to export.

183
00:27:50.570 --> 00:28:02.470
Karim T.: maybe also holds. The Plugin is a communicating with Bezu, you know, to not have different way for the consensus about another way for shipping or something like that.

184
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.420
Gary Schulte: Exactly. Yeah.

185
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:20.229
Matt Nelson: What would be sorry? Can you like repeat that? Just the way the way that the actual Api is interfacing with basic. We need to make sure we're documenting. We had to specify the interface between the Plugin and Basil.

186
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.009
Karim T.: who is the 2 component of sharing information or communicating

187
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:37.959
Karim T.: just so just to not have someone using maybe a specific library. And the another plugin is using another way to to make some data. And like that, it'd be just random code for

188
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.570
Karim T.: each plug-in. So

189
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.400
Matt Nelson: yeah.

190
00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.209
Matt Nelson: yeah, maybe we can start with the trial shipping is like a

191
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.549
Matt Nelson: point that we can use to show, like

192
00:28:51.880 --> 00:29:02.449
Matt Nelson: what we should be doing as far as updates is for the interface. Any design goals that, like what are the design goals of expanding the interface to the try logs.

193
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:08.270
Matt Nelson: and basically new documentation changes. I can also start some of this, too, as well, and get some of the

194
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.620
Matt Nelson:  you know, technical details from, you know.

195
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.570
Matt Nelson: Okay, that's some notes there.

196
00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.990
Matt Nelson: Any other questions here?

197
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:33.290
Matt Nelson: Cool. yeah. More to come on this. I think

198
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.589
Matt Nelson: it's just going to be a moving process, kind of a moving target

199
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.109
Matt Nelson: now on to deprecation. So

200
00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:52.870
Matt Nelson: we for these don't necessarily all have to go into 23.7. But we're looking to deprecate 3 things, one of which is already committed.

201
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:58.829
Matt Nelson: so in 23.7 0, we're already committed to removing, go forum compatible privacy modes.

202
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:07.959
Matt Nelson: these are not even technically documented in the basic docs. So we're hoping that no users are actually using this but we will be removing

203
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.280
Matt Nelson: the go from compatible privacy.

204
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:14.050
Matt Nelson: Kind of interfaces in 23 7 any.

205
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.589
Nischal Sharma: Oh, I have that pl, a Pr. link for that.

206
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:22.170
Matt Nelson: Oh, perfect. Yeah, if you could in the chat, I'll throw it down there.

207
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.659
Matt Nelson: Oh, here we go. Is it? A yeah. 5607.

208
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.230
Matt Nelson: Amazing. Thank you very much.

209
00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:43.010
Matt Nelson:  also database version 0. So we currently have versions one and 2, one being for us to being bonds. I, if I have it correct, and database version 0 is kind of a really old legacy

210
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.469
Matt Nelson: version that we no longer use. and this is a Pr to clean up

211
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.300
Matt Nelson: that version 0

212
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.510
Matt Nelson: alongside some other stuff.

213
00:30:53.230 --> 00:31:02.080
Karim T.: there is also also a modification in Cpr, so maybe I will split this into 2 in order to have on these

214
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:06.630
Karim T.: version, 0 deprecation in on one pier. So

215
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.240
Karim T.: it's going to be, you know.

216
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.400
Matt Nelson: Gotcha.

217
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:22.609
Matt Nelson: we're also looking to remove World State pruning on forest nodes. This one might be more of interest to folks on the call on the private network side.

218
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:27.509
Matt Nelson: because the removal of this

219
00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:36.770
Matt Nelson: this feature never actually was thoroughly tested and thoroughly worked. Super. Super. Well, but our people using this on their network, you can't really prune

220
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:50.940
Matthew Whitehead: like the Qbft ibft to stuff from what I've gathered. So I don't think any of you are using this, but I'm not sure. And if we just start calling it not

221
00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.880
Fabio Di Fabio: awesome, this also

222
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:05.749
Fabio Di Fabio: is connected to making the bone side of the phone, because if you want

223
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:13.200
Fabio Di Fabio:  the same space, if your used case is to save space, then

224
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.440
Fabio Di Fabio: one size, the preferred solution.

225
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.659
Fabio Di Fabio: why, if you use

226
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.880
Fabio Di Fabio: all rest.

227
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:32.269
Fabio Di Fabio: you probably want to have also this story, and so running should not be an option for you.

228
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:41.880
Fabio Di Fabio: and I haven't seen recently any discussion about this feature on the

229
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.780
Fabio Di Fabio: it's good also. So I you public.

230
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:53.880
Fabio Di Fabio: they appreciate for deprecating to make, maybe if someone is using it. But we are not aware.

231
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.320
Fabio Di Fabio:  what do you think we we can

232
00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:07.709
Fabio Di Fabio: put a warning or be more aggressive on that. It's a if you want to

233
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.399
Fabio Di Fabio: enable tooling, you have to

234
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.760
Fabio Di Fabio: past twice the option. Something like that. Go all the wise. Alright.

235
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:25.449
Fabio Di Fabio: yeah, we have all these, these we already have a deprecation. Notice, I think it's okay to

236
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.590
Fabio Di Fabio: okay.

237
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.770
Karim T.: And these are disabled. Printing will not

238
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:33.680
Karim T.: works. So so database or something like that. So

239
00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.950
Karim T.: I think we can be aggressive and just.

240
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.710
Fabio Di Fabio: we can put the

241
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:46.240
Fabio Di Fabio: in the next. If there are.

242
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:53.400
Fabio Di Fabio: if there is a agreement, we can put a warning if you have this option enabled, so

243
00:33:53.880 --> 00:34:02.170
Fabio Di Fabio: notified by warning that these is deprecated and will be removed in a future of the

244
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.289
Fabio Di Fabio: okay, I I I can propose a

245
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.449
Fabio Di Fabio: up here for that.

246
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.040
Fabio Di Fabio: So

247
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.749
Fabio Di Fabio: at the warming it will deprecate the

248
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:26.790
Fabio Di Fabio: add, deprecate annotation to the

249
00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:31.670
Matt Nelson: sounds good.

250
00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:36.350
Matt Nelson: It looks like we have agreement on pushing these all into 23 7.

251
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:44.820
Matt Nelson: And again, we'll have released candidates. So as you test the release candidate if there's any weirdness

252
00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:49.769
Matt Nelson: in either tooling or anything else, just let us know, and we can always revert.

253
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.690
Matt Nelson: we can always revert them or just have a discussion and figure it out.

254
00:34:55.150 --> 00:35:00.030
Gary Schulte: Could you remind me what the tentative schedule is for? 23, 7, 0.

255
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:06.789
Matt Nelson: Yeah. So since we had a since we just had 2,304 like last week. Our goal would be

256
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:12.839
Matt Nelson: a week, probably to start burning either the week of sorry the Friday of next week.

257
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:19.980
Matt Nelson:  the timing is bad with some with each CC. And some other stuff.

258
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:27.489
Matt Nelson: But again, we it's a release candidate, so we can just kind of put it out there and see.

259
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.380
Matt Nelson: But I my presumption would be that we would cut something next Friday. Gary.

260
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:33.510
Gary Schulte: perfect.

261
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.379
Matt Nelson: Say, just put this in here

262
00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:44.889
Matt Nelson: burn in Friday the 20

263
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.000
Matt Nelson: first. Hmm.

264
00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.320
Matt Nelson: what's this? Friday? The eleventh?

265
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.139
Matt Nelson: Yeah, it's twenty-first.

266
00:35:58.650 --> 00:35:59.590
Matt Nelson: Awesome.

267
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.810
Matt Nelson: Hey? The last thing is checker. Justin. This is all you

268
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:17.000
Justin Florentine: okay? but to do so I don't know if folks have been following along on a very large, very long list feature branch for

269
00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.249
Justin Florentine: E. I. P. 4, 4.

270
00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.769
Justin Florentine: Thank you, Matt.

271
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.720
Justin Florentine: But

272
00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:35.070
Justin Florentine: we're introducing some. You know a whole lot of this stuff for a new feature, and one of the things we have now is a data gas.

273
00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:39.839
Justin Florentine: new tech gas. which is typically represented with the 64 bit integer.

274
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:55.279
Justin Florentine: Dano makes a point in the Pr, where he's saying that. you know, he got a lot of performance improvements in the past by switching to primitives from more strongly type things that extend by the raise via to any.

275
00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:04.159
Justin Florentine: So he kind of raised this as a performance concern. I raised it as a You know the counter to. That is a readability concern. Where, when? The

276
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.790
Justin Florentine: excuse me.

277
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:26.750
Justin Florentine: when the reader has a long that they're looking at in Java, they kind of assume that it's assigned long right. and there's no good way to communicate to them that you know they shouldn't add them together. They should be using bitwise operators instead, etc., etc., he suggested, as a compromise, this thing called the checker framework.

278
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:40.559
Justin Florentine:  I don't know if anybody has an experience with this. It has been around for quite some time. It's been around for over 10 years. It is active. there are regular release and commits to it, and so

279
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:53.109
Justin Florentine: I don't really see a problem with introducing this to the code base. I just wanted to, you know, bring it up on a call. So everybody else had a chance to weigh in maybe express any past experiences with it, etc.

280
00:37:53.230 --> 00:38:02.620
Justin Florentine: But what this would allow us to do basically is to treat certain logs as sign. Excuse me unsigned integers right?

281
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:17.209
Justin Florentine: And use annotations on them to make sure at pre-compile time that so we're not making any unsafe assumptions about what's in that? 64 bits. So

282
00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.790
Justin Florentine: questions, comments, concerns, open discussion, etc.

283
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:34.300
Gary Schulte: Is that like a static analysis type tool? Or how is, how would we integrate that in with the existing Ci and tests?

284
00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:38.949
Justin Florentine: I think it's like error prone where it's like a set of annotations.

285
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:50.589
Gary Schulte: Sounds good. I mean, it sounds uncontroversial, has there any any downsides to it?

286
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:56.200
Justin Florentine: I've only been reading about it, so I'm not sure but I haven't read any.

287
00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.979
Justin Florentine: It's not possible to

288
00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:05.359
Diego López León: to have a a Pr. Against the the current state of the Evm. Just to see how that will look like

289
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.670
Diego López León: before introducing this pr.

290
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:13.270
Justin Florentine: absolutely, I I I would not do it on this. Pr, I don't think because this Pr is massive.

291
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.200
Justin Florentine: Okay, so yeah, I I would definitely want to do isolate it somewhere else, not included here.

292
00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:25.630
Gary Schulte: So we're we're talking about using the checker framework on. Dan was already

293
00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.469
Gary Schulte: committed work. We're using primitives in the Vm, right?

294
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.240
Diego López León: Exactly. Yep.

295
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:32.430
Gary Schulte: awesome.

296
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.769
Gary Schulte: That is a little scary to me. So I I I think checker framework sounds awesome.

297
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:42.610
Justin Florentine: great

298
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:49.550
Justin Florentine: as ever feel free to reach out to me with questions, comments, or concerns. And I think that's all I needed.

299
00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:57.900
Matt Nelson: sweet.

300
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.500
Matt Nelson: I think we're ahead of time, which means we have open discussion.

301
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.460
Matt Nelson: any topics in this kind of open forum

302
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:18.570
Matt Nelson: thing. We could review the metrics, but I don't really want to at any time you can review these metrics. They just show

303
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.280
Matt Nelson: that people are using Basil, which is crazy.

304
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:30.950
Nice

305
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:39.910
Matt Nelson: cool. This is some fun data. I don't really know

306
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:45.390
Matt Nelson: any topics, any any open topics? We can also.

307
00:40:46.010 --> 00:41:02.539
Nischal Sharma: yeah, also, I have, like a. So we are working on this benchmarking performance of peso using caliber. So this is a mentorship program hypothesis. So basically, one of our mentors working on it. So basically, what we want, or we need to, you know. Add

308
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:21.479
Nischal Sharma: few for close into carrier and then benchmark basically using it. So we did it. And the performance is not that great? right now what we are getting. So let's I just wanted to, you know, get like, if you you are doing this performance like, regularly. So is there a. So just a setup or something

309
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:26.790
Nischal Sharma: that we should stick to? So basically, we are focusing on this. Q bfk, and I b ft.

310
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:56.999
Ameziane Hamlat: so we we didn't like do this kind of load testing on, especially on the networks we like. At some period we tried to implement the caliber test. But we had some some issues. And then we just just gave up. But I I'm definitely interested. What? What? I like the results you had, and and see if I if I can help. And

311
00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:02.729
Ameziane Hamlat: yeah. So yes, because because our focus

312
00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:08.269
Ameziane Hamlat: like the last mouse was on on main net.

313
00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:17.110
Ameziane Hamlat: so, yeah, if you have some results on on, like on previous networks. yeah, I can take a look and and see if you can find something.

314
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.170
Nischal Sharma: Okay? Yeah, sure. Sure.

315
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:28.499
Nischal Sharma: So yeah. like, with the result about the repo or resulted report, we will be sending a mail then, or in the basso meaning list.

316
00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:31.830
Nischal Sharma: whatever we find.

317
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.300
Matt Nelson: I would suggest discord. But I think discord is better.

318
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.920
Nischal Sharma: Okay, yeah.

319
00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:44.740
Gary Schulte: I think there's probably some some good guidelines around hardware spec performance.

320
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:50.459
Gary Schulte:  there's so some some basic things that might.

321
00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:58.720
Gary Schulte: You may or may not be using Nvme, for example. it's a different

322
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:10.539
Gary Schulte: Jvm's. And memory management options that are present. I'm not sure if you have looked into the performance tuning guide that we have, I believe, on the the Wiki currently, but that might be a good place to start for

323
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:14.059
Gary Schulte: the baseline test harness for caliper.

324
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.089
Nischal Sharma: Okay, yeah, we'll look into that. Then.

325
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:26.949
Ameziane Hamlat: yeah. Also, we find something very interesting. But we like we, we, we haven't enough time like to dig into the details and like.

326
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:40.069
Ameziane Hamlat: do the real implementation. I just did a box So if I remember correctly, it was on to b ft, and So this is more related to block processing

327
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:50.139
Ameziane Hamlat: and we found that the block is actually processed 3 times so like each time we import the block

328
00:43:50.180 --> 00:44:00.279
Ameziane Hamlat: we do it 3 times. So we are doing exactly like the same. We're executing exactly same code, same transactions. But but 3 times so

329
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:12.130
Ameziane Hamlat: I did a like a proof of concept on like just cash some data and avoid doing it 3 times and

330
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.920
Ameziane Hamlat: and we had like good improvement instead of

331
00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:21.580
Ameziane Hamlat: processing 3 times the block was processed only twice.

332
00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:31.079
Ameziane Hamlat: and we had like 33% improvement. So if you guys like have some performance issues, especially on.

333
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:40.359
Ameziane Hamlat: I would say, block processing. I can share some some data and some insight on on that. But if if you have some.

334
00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:45.089
Nischal Sharma: yeah, that will be great. Yeah, some point to to to work on that, you know.

335
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.450
Nischal Sharma: Yeah, if you could share a Pr, you see a documentation something.

336
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.410
Ameziane Hamlat: Okay?

337
00:44:52.440 --> 00:45:11.099
Matt Nelson: Yeah, that would be huge. I know that we did a lot of investigation around performance work that definitely trickles over to the proof of the authority side. But we didn't have time, like a Messian said, to like focus on those improvements, but you know, would, if if you could like, take those Pr's and kind of run with it, that would be great. And I think that we should definitely collaborate on that stuff.

338
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.710
Nischal Sharma: Yup, Yup, that' be correct. Yeah.

339
00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.680
Matt Nelson: sweet. I'll include the Pr when I get it.

340
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.880
Matt Nelson: Any other questions here folks.

341
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:25.229
Matt Nelson: comments concerns

342
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:41.049
Matt Nelson: awesome. All right. I think we can call it there.

343
00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.039
Matt Nelson: thank you very much.

344
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:48.399
Matt Nelson: I will share the notes in the contributor channel.

345
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.380
Matt Nelson: and we can, you know, have any follow ups there.

346
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:56.810
Matt Nelson: There's a lot of good stuff that came out of this to reiterate. I will send a

347
00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:09.550
Matt Nelson: little bit of like a not really a poll. But, like I'll I'll suggest some times where we can have the working group meeting around modular consensus. I'm again looking at the last week of July as our

348
00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.010
Matt Nelson: likely

349
00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.169
Matt Nelson: starting point. If that doesn't work for you all.

350
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.250
Matt Nelson: maybe we can push into August.

351
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.610
Matt Nelson: But

352
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.640
Matt Nelson: yeah, there's no giant rush. and we'll do that in discord.

353
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:27.010
Matt Nelson: And please review the materials. that we've shared. They? It's a good starting point.

354
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:33.779
Matt Nelson: and I'll dig up the I'll dig up the Plugin system workshop that's been done and share that as well.

355
00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.670
Diego López León: Thank you.

356
00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:40.880
Matt Nelson: Awesome thanks, everyone.

357
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:45.419
Matthew Whitehead: Thank you.
