00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.779
Gabriel Trintinalia: Yeah.

2
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.200
Gabriel Trintinalia: How are you?

3
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.249
Usman Saleem: Hi, Mabel Gabby, how are you doing it?

4
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.759
Gabriel Trintinalia: Yeah, that's that.

5
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.119
Sally MacFarlane: Hello.

6
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.750
Gabriel Trintinalia: hey?

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.419
Usman Saleem: Oh, I see.

8
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.870
Sally MacFarlane: Hi, Jason.

9
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.270
Gabriel Trintinalia: Jason.

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.520
sorry.

11
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.820
Just give people

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.639
couple more minutes to

13
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.819
Sally MacFarlane: going, but I think a few people much will be.

14
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.139
Sally MacFarlane: We may not get that many people today.

15
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.010
Okay.

16
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.889
Sally MacFarlane: Can you see my screen. Is it the right screen?

17
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.809
Yep.

18
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.259
Sally MacFarlane: Excellent.

19
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.750
We might get started with the

20
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.710
Sally MacFarlane: Say antitrust. Notice.

21
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.020
Sally MacFarlane: Everyone should be familiar with that.

22
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.939
Sally MacFarlane: He's being recorded.

23
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.280
Sally MacFarlane: So I mean, unless you're speaking, and

24
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.809
any general announcements

25
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.550
Sally MacFarlane: interrupt.

26
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.009
Sally MacFarlane: you can't wait.

27
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.480
Jason Frame: It happens.

28
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.049
Jason Frame: it happens, yes, we'll probably add the what at the each other for draws into the work. We'll talk to it later.

29
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.860
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah.

30
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.210
Any other general in that sense.

31
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.470
Sally MacFarlane: It

32
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.070
the roadmap.

33
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.349
Sally MacFarlane: I think we're all about Shanghai. Really.

34
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.410
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah. Good.

35
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.790
Diego López León: Hello, Hi, Sally!

36
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.740
Sally MacFarlane: We just started, so we just covered the housekeeping, and

37
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.540
Sally MacFarlane: we're gonna skip over the roadmap because really, I think we're pretty

38
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.619
Sally MacFarlane: Shanghai withdrawals, etc.

39
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.370
Sally MacFarlane: So release.

40
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.740
Sally MacFarlane: I think

41
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.840
Sally MacFarlane: the next releases plan for this week slash next week. So

42
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.650
Sally MacFarlane: I don't know Jason, if that was discussed

43
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.299
Sally MacFarlane: at the intra week at all, but

44
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.610
Sally MacFarlane: I think they were having to sort of wrap up some of that stuff and to release

45
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.870
Sally MacFarlane: in the next week to say

46
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.880
Jason Frame: I yeah. So I

47
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.839
Jason Frame: haven't any discussion when the release was gonna happen. But

48
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.550
Jason Frame: I guess from that. Yes, we've got the this is in full controls. But if you want to go and do that.

49
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.549
Jason Frame: And there's a further changes they want to get in for shape. I'm not sure if that's actually impacting on the on this or not.

50
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.590
Sally MacFarlane: Okay.

51
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.840
Sally MacFarlane: So do you want to give us a bit of an update on withdrawals and anything else from Shanghai?

52
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.460
Jason Frame: Yeah, sure. So last week, the the so which rules is that actually being most into my now. So we've got all that in there.

53
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.059
Jason Frame: and we were testing against the

54
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.160
Jason Frame: in the

55
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.429
Jason Frame: We Haven't found any major issues with thedrawal. So we did that some small fixes

56
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.570
Jason Frame: would like to around

57
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.509
Jason Frame: the the which is being fixed.

58
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.069
Jason Frame: We're currently passing all the

59
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.380
Jason Frame: all the tests with the provider, we've got a conflict issue on that it causes basically not to work with. The

60
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.329
Jason Frame: let's see

61
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.570
Sally MacFarlane: is that what I have test about running right now.

62
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.520
Jason Frame: Sorry the

63
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.219
Jason Frame: we need to make a change in basis to support.

64
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.160
Jason Frame: to to support them

65
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.090
Jason Frame: got it done.

66
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:12.420
Jason Frame: and that they are working with the reference the withdrawals reference has to working, and the but of all the executions that test the linking

67
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.639
Sally MacFarlane: is there a ticket for the company change that's required, or it's.

68
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.920
Jason Frame: Yes, I'm working on that. Let's give you a number. It is 5, 0, 2, 5.

69
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.490
Sally MacFarlane: Okay?

70
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.969
Sally MacFarlane: Oh, i'll make it.

71
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.670
Jason Frame: Yeah. And

72
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.579
Jason Frame: there's also. So we've participated. Manually run against the execution specs.

73
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.750
Jason Frame: and we have this another

74
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.689
Jason Frame: that ticket in progress to actually

75
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.349
Jason Frame: well, as part of our

76
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.530
Jason Frame: this way

77
00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.489
Jason Frame: that, but we Won't want to go in. It's not a part of the whole process.

78
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.210
Sally MacFarlane: Cool.

79
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.779
Sally MacFarlane: busy. Do you want to use an update on John 17.

80
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:25.810
Usman Saleem: Sorry. So yeah, the the work is almost ready. There was an

81
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.409
Usman Saleem: hiccup with related to the Pkcs 11 integration

82
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.690
Usman Saleem: unit test cases that we have.

83
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.010
Usman Saleem: I think, starting from Java 15 or 16.

84
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.190
Usman Saleem: They like the sun. Pkcs 11 has introduced check, which fails

85
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.090
Usman Saleem: when when we are using an Ss. Based Pkcs 11 database.

86
00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:03.440
Usman Saleem: and in our unit test cases and acceptance test cases we use an Ss. Databases, especially in only in test cases.

87
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:19.189
Usman Saleem: So in order to make Basu pass. I had to modify and recreate all those trust stores and key stores and those unit test cases to use E. C. Keys instead of the Rsa keys. The Rsa keys were failing.

88
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.349
Usman Saleem: and I all like, not in the unit test cases. But I tested the same failing logic

89
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:33.889
Usman Saleem: outside of basu with soft Tsm. It works. It only fails when it is dealing with the Mozilla and Ss.

90
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.949
Usman Saleem: So, unfortunately the the Pr. Has grown

91
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.519
Usman Saleem: in the number of files which are touched now.

92
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:48.500
Usman Saleem: They are like, you know, about 100 or something file, but the relevant changes are like quite low.

93
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:54.879
Usman Saleem: But the good thing is that the all of the test cases are now passing.

94
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.660
Usman Saleem: The

95
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.890
Usman Saleem: I will add a sort of like a known issue. Some, you know.

96
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.349
Usman Saleem: in the change log that's on my side to note down that the Pkcs 11,

97
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:15.620
Usman Saleem: integrating with an Ss. Will not work for the Rsa. Keys unless and until either and Ss. Fixes it, or

98
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:29.429
Usman Saleem: sun, or like the oracle open Gd. Case fixed for that part I will create. I will submit a bug with the with the open. Gdk: Just so that, like, you know, we take all the boxes that we want.

99
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.390
Sally MacFarlane: Is that going to impact us at all? We said it was just test case.

100
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.290
Usman Saleem: the test cases are failing because

101
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:45.799
Usman Saleem: the test case is use the N. Ss. Module for the Pcs. 11 integration. Since an Ss. Comes

102
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:51.900
Usman Saleem: free on like Linux environments and easy to set up on Mac as well.

103
00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:07.679
Usman Saleem: Soft touches, and is another open source available software based at Ssm. Pkcs 11. Hsm. Provider rest of them like when we go with the actual hardware base like lunar, just you know something. They are quite expensive.

104
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:21.279
Usman Saleem: So our unit test case is an acceptance test uses and Ssdb. By default, and that's where it is failing. So it used to pass in Java, 1112, and 13, I think, starting from Ddk. 15,

105
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:30.169
Usman Saleem: that particular setup started failing. So any user who wants to use the Dev. P. 2 P. Tls.

106
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.750
Usman Saleem: With because Cs 11

107
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.970
Usman Saleem: source

108
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:46.760
Usman Saleem: and N. Ss. Dv. Cannot use Rsa keys anymore. They have to use Ec. Keys to configure the mutual authentication. Same goes with the Q. B. It set up as well

109
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.920
Usman Saleem: any

110
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:59.959
Usman Saleem: customer or client who want to use Qv. Ft. And want to use the Pki setup that they supervise, and they want to use Pkcs 11 based database.

111
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:08.219
Usman Saleem: If they use an Ss. Space bagged ats, it will fail. It won't fail for other Hsm. Providers out there hopefully.

112
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:15.190
Usman Saleem: But it will definitely fail, for if the Nss. Is used, but then again, Nss. Is at the end of the day

113
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:21.929
Usman Saleem: is not used in production. That but that is what my understanding is, is it's it's good for testing.

114
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.560
Usman Saleem: That's about it.

115
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.010
Sally MacFarlane: right?

116
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.600
Usman Saleem: So as a result.

117
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.879
Usman Saleem: like as a result, now.

118
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:44.010
Usman Saleem: Basu supports Ec. Private keys when dealing with Pkcsl one key store as well previously. It wasn't like the Qvrt. Part wasn't able to utilize the Ec. Based keys

119
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.030
Usman Saleem: Now it does so

120
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:52.510
Usman Saleem: as part of solving the issue. We have a slightly, you know, enhanced functionality now.

121
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:58.359
Sally MacFarlane: So we we are, we are, we are! We are losing one thing I i'm hopeful that

122
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:09.400
Usman Saleem: the future releases of, and as I I i'm very surprised that there is no defect or bug filed up anywhere for this.

123
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.399
Usman Saleem: since this is a very pretty like, you know, like

124
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:19.910
Usman Saleem: very trivial implementation, or whenever you are dealing with Tls mutual authentication.

125
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.030
Usman Saleem: 99% of the time people use Rsa keys.

126
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:31.419
Usman Saleem: and this will pay like I even created a separate reproducer for it outside of this way as well, like a very simple state forward one.

127
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.550
Usman Saleem: And yeah, it fails with a very basic, simple scenario.

128
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:45.119
Usman Saleem: So yeah, I'm going to file up a bug report with with the open duty and see what they reported.

129
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:52.040
Usman Saleem: But yeah, the code changes in in the Jdk where it's happening. I've identified all of them.

130
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.880
Usman Saleem: for as far as the

131
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.479
Usman Saleem: the overall functionality goes. Yeah, our code basis. Now.

132
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.540
we'll go into compile on Jdk: 17.

133
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.890
Usman Saleem: Once. We merge this ticket in.

134
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:14.349
Sally MacFarlane: Okay. But back to your impact on users. We don't think anyone's using

135
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:19.290
Usman Saleem: that particular combination of things in production?

136
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:27.210
Usman Saleem: Yeah.

137
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.700
Usman Saleem: when dealing with the

138
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:37.160
Usman Saleem: Yeah, because yes, 11 backed by an Ns database, the Rsa keys will not work, it will fail.

139
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:52.899
Usman Saleem: So yeah, so th that that we are known issue the workaround is to use E. C. Keys or not use nss use of touches or some other Hsm. Which won't fail. But right now, because the change in Java 17

140
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.979
Usman Saleem: that will fail to work with Ms.

141
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:02.119
Usman Saleem: With Rsa keys. It will work with Ec. Keys, but it will fail with

142
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.420
Sally MacFarlane: got it

143
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.579
Usman Saleem: unless I missed something. And there is some way of

144
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.560
Usman Saleem: enabling the

145
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:16.460
Usman Saleem: that particular thing in Nss. But yeah, like, I read multiple tests

146
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.479
Usman Saleem: the whole last week. Majority of the last week was spent in fixing those test cases

147
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:36.390
Usman Saleem: also, as I created a very comprehensive Read me as well on how all those trust stores and key stores and certificates are created. That was not there before. So anyone any of the contributor

148
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:44.280
Usman Saleem: would have to go through the same thing that I got like. You know, there was no documentation whatsoever on how those unit test cases were created.

149
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:52.299
Usman Saleem: Now there will be a very deep like detailed instructions on even for end users as well

150
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:59.849
Usman Saleem: that if they want to test that particular feature of using Pkcs 11. This is how you do it like.

151
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.070
Sally MacFarlane: Excellent

152
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.039
Sally MacFarlane: that that's that's great easy.

153
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:12.490
Sally MacFarlane: There's been a few different contributors to sort of how to go. At this I was 17 and sort of chipped away at it, but it's great to finally see it.

154
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:31.420
Usman Saleem: Yeah, this particular I I thought that this particular failure was sorted out. But now this involved this was quite deep rabbit hole to fix, to feel it. But now it is, you know, takes. We work down. Essentially, we worked around that particular

155
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:36.319
Usman Saleem: issue that we were having, and because of that the Pr. Certainly grew quite a bit

156
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:37.780
Sally MacFarlane: yeah.

157
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.659
Sally MacFarlane: awesome. Just one other thing I wanted to mention here about the acceptance test, so they

158
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:58.099
Sally MacFarlane: been split into 2 separate tasks. So one is main net related exceptions test which is run on every Pr. And the second one is non-made net related, which is only run on the nightly. Build so that's things like privacy. Permission

159
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.770
Sally MacFarlane: click. Nbsp.

160
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.439
Sally MacFarlane: So so what that means is the

161
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:12.000
Sally MacFarlane: run on every Pr. Except his test task only takes about 5 min, which that's the bill time

162
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.640
Sally MacFarlane: it's a bit more pleasant.

163
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.980
Usman Saleem: Can I suggest a thing over here like? Can we update our

164
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.810
Usman Saleem: the pr checklist that we have

165
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.890
Usman Saleem: that if someone is modifying.

166
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:32.080
Usman Saleem: you know the stuff over here. They they should check a box that they have run next full acceptance. That's either in their end

167
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.549
Usman Saleem: or in the Pr. By modifying the circle. Ci.

168
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:43.110
Usman Saleem: Because otherwise I in my case the test case was failing, but my become green.

169
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.770
Usman Saleem: and I knew that that those tests will fail. So I that, like I modified

170
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:59.069
Usman Saleem: my Pr. So that my Pr. Runs the full acceptance test, like the both the main net and I don't know how feasible it is, but we should at least add a check box, which is that.

171
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:07.470
Usman Saleem: like, Have you run the acceptance test? If the full acceptance has both the main net and non-may net in your local area

172
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.560
Usman Saleem: in your local dive environment.

173
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.029
Usman Saleem: If it is touching the known main net code, somehow.

174
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.149
eventually, it will run the nightly basis, but by that time you might have introduced

175
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:30.039
Usman Saleem: it would be a difficult to track which change broke what, unless there is a check box which says that, yeah, I'm: I an acceptance test on my own.

176
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.459
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks for that suggestion.

177
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.159
Sally MacFarlane: Do you want to add that to the checklist.

178
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.949
Usman Saleem: Yeah, we should like

179
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:46.470
Awesome.

180
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.570
I think that's everything that was listed in the agenda.

181
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.740
Sally MacFarlane: Does anyone else have anything else to mention? Questions.

182
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.310
Sally MacFarlane: any other business, future topics, etc.

183
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.769
Sally MacFarlane: Otherwise it will be a quick one today.

184
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:25.430
Diego López León: Yeah, I I think Matt wanted to. Well, I I probably is not going to be in this meeting. But I want this us to discuss. Well, depending in section on your ways to I don't know, maybe organize code or something like that. But

185
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.120
Diego López León: maybe if you have some input on that for for the next meeting.

186
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.330
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah.

187
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.959
Sally MacFarlane: it's.

188
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:46.789
Sally MacFarlane: It is something that sort of a lot of people are thinking a lot about. I I don't know if anyone knows how like the answer to actually how to actually

189
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.410
Sally MacFarlane: make it happen yet.

190
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.799
Sally MacFarlane: But I get I, from my perspective, I think what we need to think about is what outcomes are we trying to achieve? But

191
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.200
Sally MacFarlane: you know, do we want a particular

192
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:09.450
Sally MacFarlane: artifact like out of the bill process for a particular used case? Or

193
00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:19.399
Sally MacFarlane: do we want separation of concerns? Do we want a different release?

194
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.800
Sally MacFarlane: And I don't know the answers.

195
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:31.350
Diego López León: I've been trying to come up with a new main.

196
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.560
Diego López León: just for for, etc.

197
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.710
I've been trying to use dagger

198
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.319
Diego López León: so far. It's a good experience. I mean it's.

199
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:49.509
Diego López León: Personally, I I think it. I I like it. It's super simple, and a lean layer, so it's not us

200
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.960
Diego López León: big as a spring or any other, or juice

201
00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.249
Diego López León: for for the dependency in section which I think it's. It's nice

202
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.980
Diego López León: to

203
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:05.060
Diego López León: Yeah, I don't know to have a a framework to provide us to this dependencies section. But no; that in

204
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:12.190
Diego López León: as much as a spring up to to as a dependency of, or even as of different practices.

205
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:19.230
Diego López León: So that that's what I've been doing. I I based on what I think was shitty.

206
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:25.589
Diego López León: He did on on the spring. He he didn't spike for for adding spring boot.

207
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:35.009
Diego López León: So I I I based my my work on that. Then I have to to stop doing it, because well, I had to to explore a bit about a a minor

208
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:43.330
Diego López León: that wanted to to connect with Basil, but so far it has been a like a place in the experience, and and that is not so bad.

209
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.220
So

210
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.780
Diego López León: yeah, that's my input on that.

211
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.330
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, awesome.

212
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.559
Sally MacFarlane: I think as well. There is

213
00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:02.640
Sally MacFarlane: the Us. Time Zone version of this call, I think, is tomorrow.

214
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:09.450
Sally MacFarlane: so and Matt will be on that call, and the and the Us. Folks from consensus. So

215
00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.710
Diego López León: yeah, I don't know I have it on my schedule, it says reschedule.

216
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.720
Diego López León: But I don't know what that means.

217
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.590
Sally MacFarlane: I think it was rescheduled to

218
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.370
Sally MacFarlane: 10 am. Tomorrow Eastern time.

219
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.360
Diego López León: Okay.

220
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.130
I've got a link for the on calendar.

221
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.870
Oh, awesome.

222
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.450
Sally MacFarlane: That's the real game.

223
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.010
Sally MacFarlane: Okay?

224
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:49.869
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, maybe i'll just share them. I can.

225
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.840
Sally MacFarlane: You can log in.

226
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.050
Sally MacFarlane: Let's put it in the zoom chat.

227
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.210
Diego López León: Yeah.

228
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.240
Diego López León: Thank you.

229
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.840
Diego López León: No great.

230
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.819
Sally MacFarlane: But yeah, I think the more sort of

231
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:26.679
Sally MacFarlane: experimentation and sort of spikes that people do at this point, you know. And gathering all that information, and how different sort of approaches work. I think that's all really about

232
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.590
Okay.

233
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.220
Sally MacFarlane: Awesome.

234
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.050
Anything else?

235
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.530
Sally MacFarlane: No.

236
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.380
Sally MacFarlane: okay.

237
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.770
Sally MacFarlane: thanks, everyone.

238
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.670
Gabriel Trintinalia: Thank you

239
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.670
Diego López León: Thank you. Bye, bye.

240
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.890
Diego López León: bye, bye.
