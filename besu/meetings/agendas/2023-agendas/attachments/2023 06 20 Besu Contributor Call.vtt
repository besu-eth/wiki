1
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.989
Gabriel Trintinalia: I saw it.

2
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.730
Sally MacFarlane: We'll give everyone a few

3
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.830
minutes to join

4
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.150
Gabriel Trintinalia: by. Then

5
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.690
Sally MacFarlane: we'll give everyone a few more minutes to join.

6
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.850
Gabriel Trintinalia: Yeah, sure.

7
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.679
Share my screen.

8
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.000
Sally MacFarlane: The agenda.

9
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.860
Simon (siladu): Hi, Simon!

10
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.340
Gabriel Trintinalia: It's time on!

11
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.379
Simon (siladu): There they go!

12
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.260
Sally MacFarlane: We might kick off, and like

13
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.550
Sally MacFarlane: one more minute.

14
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.380
Sally MacFarlane: I can't buy my clock. That's one moment

15
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.240
I will start

16
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.570
Sally MacFarlane: So

17
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.789
Sally MacFarlane: I am already sharing my screen. Yes,

18
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:49.110
Sally MacFarlane: agenda housekeeping first off the and I just notice everyone on the call should be already familiar with that. If you're not at the link

19
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.930
Sally MacFarlane: anything recorded me just I think we need to worry about the right hand.

20
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.020
It's only a handful of people on the call

21
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.309
Sally MacFarlane: feel free to interrupt me if you have a question comment.

22
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.730
Sally MacFarlane: general announcement, I don't have any.

23
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.250
Sally MacFarlane: Does anyone on the call have any general announcement?

24
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.680
Simon (siladu):  hmm.

25
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.709
Sally MacFarlane: okay,

26
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.470
Sally MacFarlane: the roadmap.

27
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.850
Sally MacFarlane: I actually don't know, if that's been updated recently.

28
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.580
Sally MacFarlane: I think at the moment we're all about. And

29
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.629
Sally MacFarlane: yeah, I think that's fairly up today.

30
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.440
Sally MacFarlane: okay, release updates, we might actually.

31
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.000
Sally MacFarlane: I was, gonna say, skip that and move on wedding for stuff on his doing the ben in. But

32
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:15.730
Sally MacFarlane: we can probably do the updated way. So 23, 4, 2 that, and then on Friday as I understand it, there's an issue with the spot database

33
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.469
Sally MacFarlane:  new feature. So there was a no corner exception that fixes already gone in for that this morning.

34
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.139
Sally MacFarlane: So the plan is to restart like start an event. And basically

35
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.160
Sally MacFarlane: because.

36
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.369
Sally MacFarlane: as I, my understanding is that we really want that database to be the

37
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.839
Sally MacFarlane: so

38
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.950
Sally MacFarlane: key feature in this new release. So without the flat database in those behind an experimental

39
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.410
Sally MacFarlane: right

40
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.040
Sally MacFarlane: we kind of want that in the release. So we're starting a new burning

41
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.549
Sally MacFarlane: today. Any comments on that.

42
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.779
Simon (siladu): I think it's

43
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:09.770
Simon (siladu): I. I I'm not too familiar with it. Yeah, but I think it's it's the heel mechanism for the flat database

44
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.370
Simon (siladu): rather than

45
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.550
Simon (siladu): well, so it's like.

46
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.290
Simon (siladu): I think we we've always had the flat database, but it's

47
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.520
Simon (siladu): I guess, filling, filling it to

48
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.350
Simon (siladu): pretty complete. I think his boss this is doing

49
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.610
Sally MacFarlane: right. Gotcha

50
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.689
Simon (siladu): but yeah, it looks like it was

51
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.850
Simon (siladu): some kind of refactoring was done. This is feature toggle, but there was some refactoring done

52
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:51.030
Simon (siladu): that affected the when the feature was off as well, and that was where the bug was and I think it was. I think there's a point around this around how we

53
00:06:51.420 --> 00:07:06.790
Simon (siladu): like review and test Pr, especially big ones. I think what might have happened here is that it was, like all tested, thoroughly tested, and reviewed, and stuff. But then changes remained as a result of the review.

54
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:14.280
Simon (siladu): and some of the re testing was missed. I with the featured like. Oh.

55
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.330
Simon (siladu): So I think

56
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:25.400
Simon (siladu): I I mean, ultimately he. The proposal about the change to the release process. But it's

57
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.969
Simon (siladu): I think it's it's very owners to have to retest everything. Why not?

58
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.959
Simon (siladu): So? I think 1 one thing we could do in the short term is.

59
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:52.830
Simon (siladu): maybe we do most of the Co review before most of the testing, if that makes sense. But you you probably always gonna have to do some some manual test to make sure you think you're ready?

60
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.890
Simon (siladu): but maybe we should kind of

61
00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:02.650
Simon (siladu): default to like getting the code ready to review before we do like the most extensive

62
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.809
Simon (siladu): portion of the test

63
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.429
Simon (siladu): that my output I I mean, this is all kind of some ad hoc, and there's no

64
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:18.470
Simon (siladu): all right official process around it, anyway. But it's with probably mentioning in chat about really

65
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:27.800
Simon (siladu):  so like, I guess it's relevant, if like, if you're reviewing the Pr and asking about the testing and stuff like this

66
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:41.159
Simon (siladu): which I've done before, like I think it's probably worth. Be in mind that maybe we should test at the end just before merge, because 1 one small line could break everything.

67
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.140
Simon (siladu): the

68
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.569
Sally MacFarlane: yeah, it's it's a fair point.

69
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:57.440
Sally MacFarlane: I I'd really like to see more of this automated, because I feel like as long as it's manual. And we're relying on, you know, individual

70
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.200
Sally MacFarlane: individuals to to always do the right thing. It's just it's just error. Prime.

71
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:12.410
Simon (siladu): Exactly. Yeah. And and this is well, I I guess. Might as well talk about it. It's kind of related to

72
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:27.109
Simon (siladu): what I'm trying to get out with the burning process changing the is that we like we we are effectively relying on the burning process. Cache things like this which it did, which is good.

73
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.429
Simon (siladu): What that means is especially the fact that it was over. The weekend

74
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:37.389
Simon (siladu): means that I think like a release cycle. Well,

75
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:52.399
Simon (siladu): the time, what's the word like lead time for for completing a piece is actually because of that. And I think we got quite lucky with this one. It it was really obvious which committed it was because of the that trace. But

76
00:09:52.540 --> 00:10:00.939
Simon (siladu): I think if you have, you know, multiple commits or maybe doing, but it changes. And now.

77
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:08.940
Simon (siladu): relying on the not that they are overlying. But you know, I mean if if you

78
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:19.740
Simon (siladu): and they can be caught. difficult to to find the issue. So basically long winded way of saying, I agree with you, I think we should put time into.

79
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.650
Simon (siladu): That's a regression test, which is kind of the point of

80
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.029
proposal as well.

81
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.820
Sally MacFarlane: So the proposal you're talking about is this one.

82
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:34.990
Simon (siladu): But the

83
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.769
Simon (siladu): so yeah,

84
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:47.250
Simon (siladu): maybe I should wait till we get to that.

85
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.340
Simon (siladu): Yeah. But basically, I think where we are with this is that

86
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.609
Simon (siladu): I don't think this too much puts push back around.

87
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:03.039
Simon (siladu): replacing the quarterly releases with a deprecation policy.

88
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:13.030
Simon (siladu): so I think I'd be happy to kind of do the final call for that bit and and start actioning that after maybe the next

89
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:23.300
Simon (siladu): one of these calls in the other times, and just get one final chance. That piece of it, I think, is is good to go

90
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.800
Simon (siladu): and then also

91
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:32.569
Simon (siladu): suggesting about effectively, well, keeping the main that's release full of it says that which would mean

92
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.959
Simon (siladu): like. you don't really need a burning, because all the testing has happened before main.

93
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:47.930
Simon (siladu): Not really. We can't obviously do that right away. I think it's too error to to rely on

94
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.889
Simon (siladu): the testing and retesting and stuff in Prs to happen.

95
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:59.029
Simon (siladu): I do agree. There was some pushback about, not for me. But I'm processed. I do agree with that.

96
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.860
Simon (siladu): but I think it'd be good to get like a commitment.

97
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:08.120
Simon (siladu): But the direction we want to move in is to replace the burning with regression tests.

98
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:20.989
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, I I like the idea of having the regression tests that would be run on every Pr that would make sure. Yeah, there's no regressions, basically

99
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.859
Sally MacFarlane: and then that would definitely

100
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:32.859
Sally MacFarlane: reduce the number of errors that the burning might catch, and maybe maybe it would. Totally.

101
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:40.860
Sally MacFarlane: I don't know. I feel like they they kind of 2 different questions. But yeah, I hey. yeah.

102
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:51.379
Simon (siladu): yeah, it's all about the speed of the feedback L, really, and the but it is quite a reliable and catching some, a lot of bugs.

103
00:12:51.520 --> 00:13:04.420
Simon (siladu): Yeah, but it when when something does happen like this, then you see how kind of painfully so it is because it's going to be, you know. Basically a week it's taken. It will have taken us to release by the end of the second round.

104
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:18.799
Sally MacFarlane: Yes. So then, what are the next steps?

105
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:27.380
Simon (siladu): so yeah, it would be good to get kind of point

106
00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:33.729
Simon (siladu): purple agreement. But people who are interested to that like we're looking towards.

107
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.949
Simon (siladu):  we that every question test and like

108
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.070
Simon (siladu): definitely, not in the very back, I guess, would be the the end goal. With that

109
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:59.509
Simon (siladu):  and yeah, we could trial the application. That is thing. As soon as kind of everyone agrees, I guess, but I guess the next step is to not do the next call to the release

110
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:06.689
Simon (siladu): and maybe update the change log with any breaking changes that would have gone in there

111
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:19.949
Simon (siladu): and decide how long they need to be. We need to wait. I think it's what I put in this suggested policy that everybody. you know it's made up to the to decide how long we should wait

112
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.260
Simon (siladu): for that change that they want to make.

113
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:34.030
Simon (siladu): So yeah, so formalizing the suggested policy, I guess would be kind of the next step in that. And then.

114
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.329
Sally MacFarlane: okay, so

115
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.729
Sally MacFarlane: sorry did I miss any next steps. I think it would be good to sort of

116
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.730
Simon (siladu): they not catches it. Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.220
Sally MacFarlane: Okay. Cool.

118
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:53.460
Sally MacFarlane: Awesome.

119
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.780
Sally MacFarlane:  Okay. We might go back up to

120
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.730
to leave.

121
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.149
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, any anyone comment on the release.

122
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:15.710
Sally MacFarlane: Simon, you did the last release. Do you know, can we update the 23, 4 to release that we already

123
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.909
Sally MacFarlane: sort of started? Or do we need to? Does the next one need to be 23

124
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.410
Sally MacFarlane: like, can we? Can we patch this really? So doing. Into just go the next one.

125
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:32.810
Simon (siladu):  good question. I think technically, you can

126
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:39.089
Simon (siladu):  think, maybe when this is happening in the past, we bump the version.

127
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:47.359
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, I feel like it's clear out if we just bump the version, and we say 23, four-two bio, and then the next one's 23, 4, 3.

128
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:56.119
Simon (siladu): I it. Yeah, it won't avoid any any issues, for sure it's not too much that. But

129
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:01.789
Simon (siladu): yeah, I let me take that offline and double check. But

130
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:16.210
Simon (siladu): yeah, I don't know if it's really a huge issue if we can announce it. But it's, you know, technically, people might have pulled the code already, and it's a change from them which isn't great, maybe especially on the docket guys.

131
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.350
Sally MacFarlane: Yes.

132
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.239
Sally MacFarlane: okay, cool. Thank you. Yeah. I will confirm off on.

133
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:27.710
Sally MacFarlane: okay. So next item on the agenda is about 4 or 4,

134
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.679
Sally MacFarlane: the embryo, do you want to give a quick update on that?

135
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.760
Gabriel Trintinalia: Yeah.

136
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.979
Gabriel Trintinalia: the majority of desks are implemented like the outstanding desks that we had for 7. At 6

137
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.160
the pr is marked as ready for reveal.

138
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.859
Gabriel Trintinalia: I think the goal is to merge that into main.

139
00:16:53.120 --> 00:17:00.839
Gabriel Trintinalia: and the next 6 doesn't seem to be as it's more as it was supposed to be.

140
00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.179
Gabriel Trintinalia: there were some issues there, and

141
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.869
Gabriel Trintinalia: apparently they are kind of different, for its clients are following different forks.

142
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.590
Gabriel Trintinalia: But it's being investigated.

143
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.340
Sally MacFarlane: And the. it's not just basic right.

144
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.379
Gabriel Trintinalia: I don't think it's just based on yes. Now.

145
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.349
Sally MacFarlane: yeah. Cool

146
00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.890
Sally MacFarlane: the way keeping up. Oh, no.

147
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.510
Sally MacFarlane: that you know, we're on part with the other clients at the moment.

148
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.540
Gabriel Trintinalia: Yeah, yeah, I think we are

149
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:37.970
Sally MacFarlane: cool.

150
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:46.669
Gabriel Trintinalia: Justin is going to investigate on his back tonight.

151
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.040
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, cool.

152
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.439
Sally MacFarlane: so other business. We kind of covered the

153
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.690
Sally MacFarlane: avoid cherry page released

154
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.980
Sally MacFarlane: process.

155
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:05.940
Sally MacFarlane: So the next one on the agenda is the debug log improvement proposal.

156
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.529
Sally MacFarlane:  I think I have that?

157
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.800
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah. So this one is just about basically

158
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.570
Sally MacFarlane: making debug level logging use, actually useful for people who are trying to debug stuff. Right?

159
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:37.340
Simon (siladu): Yeah, I I haven't had any kind of disagreement with this. in principle like it might be a big. I just kind of repeat this here to to in this. More people see it, and

160
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.429
Simon (siladu): nicely, Charlotte, if you go any objections, and

161
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.759
Simon (siladu): as well and hopefully we can.

162
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:50.730
Simon (siladu): I think it's the kind of the fiscal policy. And then we kind of try and stick to this.

163
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.239
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, I I think that might be

164
00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:03.769
Simon (siladu): no, this is quite today, still, to the existing books. But that's just yeah.

165
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:11.309
Sally MacFarlane: yes, it works kind of under way on that right? This already. Some pr, and I guess if people

166
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.380
Sally MacFarlane: developers, users notice things that are.

167
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.849
Sally MacFarlane: you know, to noisy at debug level, we could raise issues.

168
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.339
Simon (siladu): Yeah, I mean it. Just I just wanted to kind of.

169
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:32.059
Simon (siladu): I guess. Get an agreement to socialize the thing to aim for for debug, and and then hopefully, it will get picked up in reviews and things. So

170
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:41.470
Sally MacFarlane:  and we sign up for the next steps on that one as well.

171
00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:51.240
Simon (siladu): well, I I can't remember if I put it on the agenda for the other time zone.

172
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.799
Simon (siladu): Oh, sorry! I'll do it at least once more there and then.

173
00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.200
Simon (siladu): if no one can. about it.

174
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:30.180
Sally MacFarlane:  What's the best place for people to give like if someone is.

175
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.330
Sally MacFarlane: Yes, I agree. What's the best place to do that?

176
00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:41.360
Simon (siladu): I guess it's easy to traffic. It's on the proposal itself on the actual proposal.

177
00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.910
Simon (siladu): I'll be watching discord anyway. So this would work as well.

178
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:54.949
Simon (siladu): Yeah, I haven't particularly mentioned it in discord. I will do before. Kind of finalize it.

179
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.150
Simon (siladu): just to make sure everyone's seen it.

180
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.860
Sally MacFarlane: Hello!

181
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:19.040
Sally MacFarlane: okay, that's everything that's on the agenda. Anything else anyone wants to raise.

182
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.700
Sally MacFarlane: No awesome.

183
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.570
Sally MacFarlane: Let's call it done

184
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.980
Simon (siladu): here.

185
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.090
Sally MacFarlane: Thanks all.

186
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.440
Simon (siladu): Thank you.
