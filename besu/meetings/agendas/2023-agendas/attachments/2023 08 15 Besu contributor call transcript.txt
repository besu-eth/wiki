00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.430
Jason Frame: Hey, Sammy?

2
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.430
Sally MacFarlane: Hello!

3
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.969
Jason Frame: Got a few more minutes, but maybe it's only yesterday. Why not say no.

4
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.600
Sally MacFarlane: Could be a quiet call.

5
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.339
Jason Frame: Okay, there's nothing much on the agenda, but I did put some items in about the release. But yeah.

6
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.870
Jason Frame: it's a bypass right.

7
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.710
Jason Frame: Think we can probably get started. But we might not haven't even asked. Join us today. But

8
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.090
Jason Frame: so it could be a short call. I'm just gonna

9
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.810
Jason Frame: my screen now.

10
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.550
Jason Frame: Alright.

11
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.210
Jason Frame: hopefully, you can

12
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.620
say that.

13
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.480
Sally MacFarlane: Yep.

14
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.999
Jason Frame: notice there you can look, click through to see that.

15
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:42.659
Jason Frame: It's nice that this means being recorded. So the recording is already started. Stay on mute speaking, and

16
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.640
Jason Frame: So, looking at the agenda, we don't have anything under general announcements.

17
00:04:49.660 --> 00:05:03.589
Jason Frame:  to talk about or any work updates. But I'll have to start. Ask Did you have anything for general announcements Sally or anyone else to

18
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.190
Jason Frame: might be on the call?

19
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:16.079
Sally MacFarlane: No, no general announcements. I could probably give a quick update on right before. Yeah, that'd be awesome. Right? Thank you. So yeah.

20
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.470
Jason Frame: should go.

21
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.289
Jason Frame: There'll be under work updates. Let's do that we normally do that first, I think

22
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.590
Jason Frame: ever.

23
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.220
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah. So

24
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.950
Sally MacFarlane: Justin, from jubicabra and my team are kind of working on for it for 4 4

25
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.520
Sally MacFarlane: stuff. So there's some hive tests that are failing.

26
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.840
Sally MacFarlane: There's a

27
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:52.309
Sally MacFarlane: the engine for choice updated method. We haven't implemented that in basic yet. So that we're hoping to get that one done today. and then there's

28
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.169
Sally MacFarlane: some Dennis got a Pr up for some sort of related

29
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:05.670
Sally MacFarlane: look. It's a rename from bob gas. So we're gonna review that one today.

30
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.570
Sally MacFarlane: So yeah, there's just a few little things. But overall we're looking pretty good.

31
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.830
Jason Frame: Is that log guest, and it's now changed to data. Guess you said.

32
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:25.730
Jason Frame: yeah, cool. Great. Got it? Thanks, Sally. That's good. So and so is there another is there

33
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:34.259
Jason Frame: right now, the next one

34
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:42.070
Sally MacFarlane: so the other piece of the puzzle is 478, eip 4, 7, 88. So we need that for definite 8.

35
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.400
Sally MacFarlane: So that's also in progress. So there's a draft Pr

36
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.280
Sally MacFarlane: already for poison. Idiot.

37
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.830
Jason Frame: Okay?

38
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.480
Jason Frame: Good. Thanks.

39
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.920
Jason Frame: Let's face the same.

40
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.929
Jason Frame: Okay, that will make sense, then.

41
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.340
Jason Frame: Excellent. Yeah. Was there any other work? Updates you want to share?

42
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.909
Sally MacFarlane: That that's about it.

43
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.450
Jason Frame: Cool, great. Alright!

44
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.930
Jason Frame: I'll move on to the release updates. Then so

45
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.410
Jason Frame: 23 dot 7 dot 0 s. People would have seen

46
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.130
Jason Frame: That release was scrubbed. We there was a performance regression that was found

47
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.390
Jason Frame: with the kekat hash upgrade to the

48
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:41.489
Jason Frame: when upgrading the bouncy Castle library, so that because of that that release was removed.

49
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.260
Jason Frame: And and now there is a

50
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:56.200
Jason Frame: replacement release 23.7 one and there's an Rc. Currently out for that. And as far as I know, that's still that's still in progress. and I haven't heard any

51
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.660
Jason Frame: wh. Whether there's any issues with that at all the moment.

52
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.750
Jason Frame: Did you know, if there's do have you? Do you know the progress of the passing one at all?

53
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:14.749
Sally MacFarlane: I do not know. So maybe that's a question to ask and discord. As to yeah, what's the status of that?

54
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.390
Jason Frame: Yeah.

55
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.100
Jason Frame: I feel like I should know.

56
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:34.870
Jason Frame: Oh, spots correctly. okay, yep. That sounds like a good thing to do. Yeah. So yes, on that. I think this was done probably

57
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.739
Jason Frame: more than a week ago. Anyway, more. So

58
00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.829
Jason Frame: yeah should be, should be.

59
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.469
Jason Frame: should have had enough time to burn, so good to find out where that is.

60
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.039
Jason Frame: That's the only items I had in for the release.

61
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.269
Jason Frame: Both. Anything else? You want to add.

62
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.129
Sally MacFarlane: I don't have anything else.

63
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.420
Jason Frame: Okay. And what about anything else in general like

64
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.040
Sally MacFarlane: not.

65
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:19.910
Jason Frame: Okay. Well, I think that might be everything for the call then, nice and short, and we'll have to.

66
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:29.500
Jason Frame: Yeah, I'll put a question on. Just called to check on that status of the the Rc. Burn in so we can find out where that is

67
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.229
Jason Frame: very good to know. Sounds good

68
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:39.629
Jason Frame: alright. Oh, we. We have one more person. Just join.

Stefan Pingel: busy? Sorry.

71

76
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:32.069
