00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.650
Jason Frame: Hey? Easy!

2
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.400
Usman Saleem: Hello, everyone!

3
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.750
Jason Frame: It looks like everyone's here.

4
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.520
Simon Dudley: Hello.

5
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.540
Jason Frame: Share my screen and let's get started.

6
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.230
Lucas Saldanha: Yep.

7
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.820
Jason Frame: Right?

8
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.860
Jason Frame: Okay.

9
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:19.770
Jason Frame: Let's go through the housekeeping first, and sorry there. If you go to this link here, you can with the details.

10
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.800
Jason Frame: You want to put the announcement already that this is going to be recorded.

11
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.430
Jason Frame: So you don't let me go 75, and you can see anybody over.

12
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.170
Jason Frame: Yeah, it's place me in a few which is speaking, and if you have a question, you the right hands. Although being small, we can probably just

13
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.370
Jason Frame: small group. Here. You apologize. Answer on the phone.

14
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.000
Jason Frame: Okay, let's start with some 0 announcements.

15
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.070
Jason Frame: I didn't see anything listed there. Does anyone have any general announcements? They want to make

16
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.220
Jason Frame: alright. it doesn't matter.

17
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:15.210
Jason Frame: So moving past that we do the roadmaplisted here. I don't think there's anything new as the roadmap since we looked at last time.

18
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.080
Jason Frame: No, so this the Shanghai upright. I think it was like last time we hit in the twenty-th.

19
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.780
Jason Frame: I can't see what it is, but currently we will focus. We've been focused on the same line up right

20
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.010
Jason Frame: doesn't they say anything else to talk about in the right back right now

21
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.670
Jason Frame: is probably some

22
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.550
Jason Frame: on in terms of sh time.

23
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.380
Jason Frame: There's been some detail thing that I was here to the next up, right, though, so to

24
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.720
Jason Frame: So for the

25
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.710
Jason Frame: anything anyone want to discuss on the environment. But we can decide talking to the rest of the cool.

26
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.560
Jason Frame: Oh, so

27
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.180
Jason Frame: put the release rotations.

28
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.720
Jason Frame: See that the in the contributed channel. We

29
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:31.450
Jason Frame: it's been proposed to aid for March eighth for the next release. So i'll just open up this for the

30
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.950
Jason Frame: and

31
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.490
Jason Frame: what will people still? What's on the next release dates.

32
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.570
Jason Frame: So this last one was a bit later than we at home, so I think this one moves it back to a Wednesday.

33
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.530
Jason Frame: I think we did strictly 2 weeks from this. I think this is a Friday that wouldn't have

34
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.780
Jason Frame: that will not work with that typical schedule. So that's why that that was moved.

35
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:14.470
Jason Frame: was it? I think, Simon, You' this Did you get a sense? If there was a consensus on much, I spend the release time.

36
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.560
Simon Dudley: Everything off her so far has been in favor of it. I haven't. Had anyone object to it?

37
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.290
Jason Frame: Okay? Well, that sounds promising.

38
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:38.400
Jason Frame: Yeah. Okay. So so as far as we know, so far, the the next one will be much, and then from on what we'll plan to continue doing, the too quickly releases for for the point places in the 23 to one series.

39
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.780
Jason Frame: So that's the case.

40
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.590
Notice.

41
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.770
Simon Dudley: Yeah, I think we we pay kick off

42
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:10.170
Simon Dudley: totally more or less, the end of this week to make a call, because we have to start burning it. And this week. But

43
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:22.230
Jason Frame: I like, yeah, I guess it's probably too late to be any sooner than than, and I think that they one of the key things we wanted in that ideally would be the Goalie Shamp configuration if it's available.

44
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.260
Simon Dudley: Yes, I do.

45
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:37.830
Jason Frame: And let's just say we should have the Goalie Slot the start of this week, and they will for their to call, so that should work out nicely. So we should know the next few days what? That

46
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.100
Jason Frame: when goal it should happen, and we'll have enough time to employ that in the next

47
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.590
Jason Frame: by service.

48
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:52.640
Lucas Saldanha: Yeah, I think it. It probably depends on how the portfolio goes. But so a successful rollout we should be able to define quarterly in a minute next.

49
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.470
Jason Frame: Yeah, yeah. So things cost, so it works. It's good as well. We'll find out next few hours.

50
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.920
Jason Frame: I'm not sick by that. No. the samepi epic.

51
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.530
Jason Frame: So i'm. I'm not. Just. I've been this epic up.

52
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:21.100
Jason Frame: I think you're probably the person to talk to this, so i'm not to see your face there on there? Did you want to give a quick update on the how we're going with it with Shank on?

53
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.380
Simon Dudley: Sure. Yeah, I'll, I'll keep it brief, but feel free to ask any questions.

54
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.040
Simon Dudley: basically all the kind of

55
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.370
Simon Dudley: my

56
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:46.170
Simon Dudley: it's of the code. It done the things that still in progress, and still to do, related to adding in more tests and in improving the robustness of

57
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.130
Simon Dudley: on our test code, because this is quite a few different frameworks involved.

58
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:58.030
Simon Dudley: And yeah, but I i'll say I've mentioned on track for this

59
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.840
Simon Dudley: and

60
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.330
Simon Dudley: 3Â h.

61
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:12.830
Simon Dudley: And yeah, should I? If there's no issues with that? Should It's me that we think of all you want as well as minimal work to do just just configuration to add into that.

62
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:20.110
Simon Dudley: And then I actually want to main that so hopefully by the time we're on main that we'll all be

63
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:27.420
Simon Dudley: all of these items in the epic complete, and and we'll have all regression tests in place, and we'll be

64
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:35.130
Simon Dudley: in a good place, but along the side this is also a def next running, as well as the test nets the public test net. So

65
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.289
Simon Dudley: it should be pretty

66
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.350
Simon Dudley: confident. I think if we don't see any problems in that

67
00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.190
Jason Frame: right, that sounds good.

68
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.330
Jason Frame: So

69
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.160
Jason Frame: oh, so it's really cool.

70
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:16.560
Jason Frame: and we put a here for work. Update on the new Protocol deposits by an external contributor. Does anyone have any takes house?

71
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:26.560
Simon Dudley: Yeah, I put that one in in there as well. I wanted to bring this up because it's it's an external contribute to the basic which is good.

72
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:35.780
Simon Dudley: It's actually. I found out they I've come in through the

73
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:45.100
Simon Dudley: preschool fellowship. I believe she's like a kind of mentorship program. and Mikhail is is leading this project

74
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:52.930
Simon Dudley: so doing, the in Protocol deposits this. This IP is part of this another change to the

75
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.070
Simon Dudley: execution. Api as well. That is, it counts part to this.

76
00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.620
Jason Frame: And

77
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:13.160
Simon Dudley: yeah, so it's in the cars driving. That is also the mental for this contributed that as I into Pr. And basis so just working through. But it's good that I I think the Mentee

78
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:19.170
Simon Dudley: was given a choice and like effectively.

79
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.270
Simon Dudley: which is really good news, I think.

80
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:29.820
Jason Frame: Yeah, it's it's fine. See if I say you so. The reference for this or early work on the. So yeah, I think it's, anyway. So

81
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.570
Simon Dudley: that's right.

82
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.330
Simon Dudley: The change itself is really good, because it means we can get rid of

83
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:44.480
Simon Dudley: They they can chain having to like. So you stuff with the deposit logs and just makes everything work a lot nicer

84
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:49.170
Simon Dudley: unlock some features in basically like

85
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.740
Simon Dudley: for about days.

86
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.760
Jason Frame: Yeah, definitely good. Not sure. There's much to

87
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.480
Jason Frame: to. This is probably more awareness. But you just have one question Here

88
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:10.910
Jason Frame: was any reason not to include some man using the experimental experiment. So I guess that's it.

89
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:19.260
Jason Frame: We have to answer it here. But do you want to explain what you're asking there? So

90
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.450
Simon Dudley: yeah, so

91
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.970
Simon Dudley: introduced recently

92
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.460
Simon Dudley: that gets driven by some of the

93
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.260
Simon Dudley: changes

94
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:42.650
Simon Dudley: 2 new for the like internal kind of feature type of folks. There's a future, a IP time, and an experimental a IP sign future is intended to be

95
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:54.140
Simon Dudley: an upcoming fork. but I guess Hasn't got a name yet, so anything that we know is in anything to the next one would be future.

96
00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:07.760
Simon Dudley: And this experimental one, I guess, is things that haven't been agreed to go into a fork yet, but we still might want an implementation. But this reason, for example, for

97
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:15.390
Simon Dudley: so yeah, it's the first time, I think we including anything in this experiment or the Ips time

98
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.590
Simon Dudley: fork. So

99
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.510
Simon Dudley: so it was worth bringing up and save. It was appropriate.

100
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:30.480
Simon Dudley: And yeah, if anyone had objections to this particular IP you getting in there. So it's quite early guys for the cip.

101
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.140
Simon Dudley: It's not going to go in time period, apparently.

102
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:40.020
Jason Frame: Right? Okay. So we're gonna have it for a 6 months and all probably. Yeah.

103
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.220
Jason Frame: Okay.

104
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.510
Jason Frame: Did you have any thoughts on that? Maybe this is the kind of discussion we need to have on the contributors.

105
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:58.490
Jason Frame: So i'll get a few more people's thoughts on that. It seems like a good use of the experimental. I think that's exactly what it was intended for. But

106
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:08.940
Jason Frame: okay, so no, it's great for you. May we just bring to the water? But we still got time to win the most that period so we can get.

107
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.380
Jason Frame: I have the discussion on the

108
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.100
Jason Frame: and I contribute this

109
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:30.680
Simon Dudley: thanks, and and if if anyone is up for reviewing this Pr. As well, they contribute to is welcoming some early reviews, you know, in draft. So

110
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:38.160
Jason Frame: right? Yeah, so it's kind of see someone doing some easy for us.

111
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:48.700
Jason Frame: Okay, that's yeah, as far as workout times. If you are in the of a business.

112
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:54.280
Jason Frame: I think this is your right here. I'm selling on the did you? Why not?

113
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.870
Jason Frame: What this is about. And

114
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:09.270
Sally MacFarlane: yeah. yeah. So this is a feature in Github that is currently in Beta. I have tested it out in some

115
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:27.820
Sally MacFarlane: 2 other like test repositories. We haven't, tested, and basing yet, but it looks cool. It looks easy to use it's essentially the same as enabling auto merge, except that, like if another Pr. Gets most in the meantime, and you would normally need to motivate again.

116
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:34.430
Sally MacFarlane: It just handles that for you, so it essentially manages any Pr. With wedding, where you've hit the button

117
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.610
Sally MacFarlane: to add it to the queue. It manages as it as a queue.

118
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:50.230
Sally MacFarlane: The only real change to how we currently work is that if you want to, so when you set up, merge to you to squash commits as like the strategy to merge.

119
00:14:50.830 --> 00:15:06.140
Sally MacFarlane: and how we work now is, when you hit the button you get to edit the commits at that point. So the change would be that if you wanted to squash the commits and edit the message. You would need to do that manually on your

120
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.270
Sally MacFarlane: yeah

121
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:13.240
Sally MacFarlane: before you add it to the match queue. So that's kind of really the only change the way that we work right now.

122
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:18.270
Sally MacFarlane: I said. My question is. can we turn it on? Can we try it out?

123
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:31.920
Sally MacFarlane: Do we like we probably don't want to enable it in the middle of doing a release, you know, just in case there are side effects. But maybe after the release before the release. On that any objections, any concerns any questions

124
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.710
Jason Frame: so just once this features on it. One.

125
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.070
This will be the only way to

126
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.360
Sally MacFarlane: yes, correct. So if you

127
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:54.540
Sally MacFarlane: so it when you set it up, it's it's not called. Enable the match you it's called. Do you want Pr. To like? Do you require an match queue.

128
00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:01.320
Sally MacFarlane: So it just means that yeah, even if there's only one.

129
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.330
Jason Frame: Okay, yeah, I I don't have any objections. So I think it's it could help us.

130
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:15.450
Jason Frame: Maybe there's so, an at on. So I haven't had too much of an impact on to rematch, but it's only at times it happened.

131
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.230
Sally MacFarlane: and I see it comes out from the phone.

132
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.210
Jason Frame: That sounds up from the far as well. That's great.

133
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.070
Jason Frame: awesome.

134
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:38.330
Jason Frame: I don't any objections like, I said. I think that the timing with the because we don't want to do it just before we

135
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.260
Jason Frame: we want to make sure

136
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.440
Jason Frame: nothing's good here.

137
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.630
Jason Frame: did you? And you Haven't heard any injections in this code at all?

138
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:58.450
Sally MacFarlane: No, the only questions are around this question. It's, but it just wouldn't. You would want to do that manually in advance

139
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:08.690
Jason Frame: There wasn't a related question, I think, relate to that. You think you said that you could actually get it to default the message in the swash commit to the description.

140
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.220
Jason Frame: Yes, yes, so that's another option. When you set it up is that

141
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:23.359
Sally MacFarlane: when you're squashing commits you can so the default that which is what we have right now is it just depends all the commit messages together.

142
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.780
Sally MacFarlane: Another option is. You have the pr description.

143
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:34.500
Sally MacFarlane: and I think this by the author's name. and and that's it.

144
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:40.070
Sally MacFarlane: So you could set that up. But then you'll end up, deal with everything, and then make my messages right. So

145
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.000
Jason Frame: okay.

146
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.600
Jason Frame: not hearing any objections to that. I I think we should.

147
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.110
Jason Frame: I think you have to go. It's a but that's like it's at the time.

148
00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.930
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah. So maybe tentatively, we say after this next release.

149
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.750
Jason Frame: and maybe we just need to ride up a little.

150
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:13.820
Sally MacFarlane: a blob on the merge commit piece, and how that works.

151
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:21.900
Jason Frame: Yeah. And and if we don't like it, I guess it's easy enough to turn that off

152
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.160
Jason Frame: problems with that.

153
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.940
Jason Frame: Okay?

154
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:42.910
Sally MacFarlane: And I think the other piece we want to think about, which has come up before is we commonly get merge conflicts in the Change log.

155
00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:51.180
Sally MacFarlane: So I think if we, you know, have a sensible ordering in the change log, so that we're not always, you know, adding to the last line

156
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.770
Sally MacFarlane: that should sort of

157
00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:58.220
Sally MacFarlane: eliminate a lot of conflicts as well. I think that has become better. But

158
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.090
Sally MacFarlane: wait and see how it guys invite you.

159
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.610
Jason Frame: You can try it out first, because

160
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:11.700
Lucas Saldanha: no you can do that. That's fine.

161
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:21.840
Jason Frame: Alright, No, that that sounds good. Okay. So i'll see. Yeah. So we got another

162
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:33.250
Jason Frame: awesome business here. It's a phone call to remove that. Basically No, this call channel. So yeah, I think we did discuss this before. Actually, I think this was some. I brought this up previously.

163
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:41.370
Jason Frame: Yes, I think you got You've got the notes here. Thank you. So on the so a few months ago. So we have some discussion.

164
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:52.440
Jason Frame: Simon, would you be out to here somewhere where the discussion stops in with the basic noise. This core channel.

165
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.710
Simon Dudley: Sure

166
00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.590
Simon Dudley: the the discussion was. It was kind of all some kind of bringing up again, really, but I think

167
00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:12.450
Simon Dudley: I think there was only one objection from down, a not an injection as such, but more clarification of that Why, I think he

168
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:24.180
Simon Dudley: created the 2 separate channels, or requested them to be create originally, which was up up to the Merge. We have again a lot of support questions. And

169
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:36.950
Simon Dudley: I think you want it to like distinguish between things that we like supporting how to run a node versus questions about basically itself like basic features and things like that.

170
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:46.470
Simon Dudley: I don't think like in my experience, people use the basic channel and the basic notes Channel interchangeably.

171
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:56.980
Simon Dudley: There was a suggestion to change it to basic support instead, which is probably more clear than by you. But I still think users would

172
00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.520
Simon Dudley: just use both of them.

173
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:07.400
Simon Dudley: I think they have the same intent. Really. it's just that. It happens to be quite a bit noise before, and that's mostly gone away now.

174
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:17.720
Simon Dudley: So I would. Yeah, I would still pay the removing basic notes and just using basic, maybe we can split it out again if there's a problem in the future that

175
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:27.220
Simon Dudley: I will. Since then I gave maybe something good for an objection before I will. Then came specifically on this.

176
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.030
Simon Dudley: I don't know.

177
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:34.340
Jason Frame: Okay. So I I I just put that in there, so

178
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.440
Jason Frame: so there's been no other objections as well

179
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.300
Jason Frame: to remove it from what he is saying.

180
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:17.430
Simon Dudley: No, no, no; it's just with the attractions it would. Yeah, it would obviously be small. Application window would be appropriate, I think, or at least just making sure that all of the questions have been answered or me that it's the other channel

181
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.460
Simon Dudley: before we actually get rid of it.

182
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.300
Okay.

183
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:27.240
Jason Frame: so it's it's been much less

184
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.320
Jason Frame: uses a usage of the basically those channels as well.

185
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:45.640
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, I I can't find the link right now. I I can dig it up, but it's basically the insight into in the discourage server. And yeah, at at the Channel level they do

186
00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:50.650
Sally MacFarlane: had like out of my 4 or 5, 10 times the traffic

187
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.730
Sally MacFarlane: by numbers of messages compared to

188
00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:01.860
Sally MacFarlane: which I think you know supposed to be that it was useful initially, but less so now.

189
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.150
Jason Frame: So yeah.

190
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:17.650
Jason Frame: thank you right there. And if I'm summarizing this correctly. It seems like there's no objections. Then the plan would be to keep some notice, and then deprecate to remove that channel.

191
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.010
Simon Dudley: Yeah, I think so

192
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.380
Simon Dudley: to kind of.

193
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.480
Simon Dudley: I know

194
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.870
Jason Frame: heck right.

195
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.960
Jason Frame: It's not just

196
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.420
Jason Frame: yeah, I think it makes sense to get rid of like. So I said, the

197
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:47.680
Jason Frame: there's not much usage in that people confused between between that channel, the other channel, I think. Unfortunately.

198
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.170
Jason Frame: it's in the volume.

199
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.400
Jason Frame: Yeah, I think that's probably the sign on that one. Just

200
00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.130
Jason Frame: so. You're gonna follow up on that with.

201
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.360
Jason Frame: But don't know. And yeah.

202
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:07.500
Simon Dudley: yeah.

203
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:08.820
Jason Frame: okay, correct.

204
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.960
Jason Frame: Yeah, that'd be good to go. But they have a channel.

205
00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:16.730
Jason Frame: Is there anything else anyone else to discuss?

206
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.830
Jason Frame: That is a that is a

207
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:37.060
Jason Frame: and is anything we want to add to the it's a next call, but we didn't get a chance to discuss this time, I guess.

208
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.440
Jason Frame: Come on, I think of that.

209
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.240
Jason Frame: Which case I will stop sharing the screen now

210
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.210
Jason Frame: it looks like that's it for the

211
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.130
Jason Frame: Thank you.

212
00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.140
Lucas Saldanha: hey? Good Jason.

213
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.060
Sally MacFarlane: Thanks, Jason.

214
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.400
Stefan Pingel: Thanks. So yeah.

215
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.740
Simon Dudley: yeah, I said.
