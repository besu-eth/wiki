Agenda

1. Welcome Alastria!
  1. P256 Roadmap
2. Fusaka Status - likely delayed for CL complexity. No known holdups on EL side.
3. Sunset Plan:
  1. Removal of PoW - but what about Clique?
4. Glamsterdam Planning - Headliners are selected, [PFI is open](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7773#proposed-for-inclusion) till we ship Fusaka ready mainnet clients.
5. Project Charter - if you haven’t approved, why not? Add a comment to that effect and tag @davidwboswell for followup.
