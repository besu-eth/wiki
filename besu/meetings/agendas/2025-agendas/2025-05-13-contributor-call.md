Agenda

1. Fusaka Planning
  1. PeerDAS is top priority. Besu has not participated in any peerdas-devnet, and we are up to number 7.
2. Sunset Plan:
  1. Removal of PoW - there are 2 PRs in flight that remove it. Is there anything that would keep us from merging them?
3. An update on the approach Bhanu is using for modularity of QBFT
4. Institutional Backlog - Matt Whitehead / Kaleido
5. Project Charter - work is proceeding through legal, will be available for all maintainers to review shortly.
