00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.960
Sally MacFarlane: There is not enough people

21
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:34.170
Sally MacFarlane: to need to give an eye on the right hand, so just yell out if you have a question today, I think, because I can't see your faces right now. Ever Um, okay, General announcements. Everything's about the merge right now. So there wasn't really anything else to even add to the agenda. Um, that's all about the merge.

22
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:43.890
Sally MacFarlane: There seems to be more messages, questions, queries, uses doing lots of things and discord. So I really appreciate everyone who is answering questions

23
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.080
Sally MacFarlane: over there. It's great I loved on this morning, and everything Pretty much had already been answered which was awesome.

24
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.640
Sally MacFarlane: Anyone else have anything to say about the match.

25
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.730
Sally MacFarlane: So we'll skip the robot

26
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:12.999
Sally MacFarlane: because we're quite focused on the short-term right now. But so the release updates between two hundred and seventy two, which was done last week. Is the merge ready invasive release?

27
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.170
Sally MacFarlane: It seems to all be going smoothly,

28
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:28.440
Sally MacFarlane: and there was no other work updates, or other business, or anything else that came up. The only other thing is, I would like to remove this item from the agenda about the metrics will be because

29
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.320
Sally MacFarlane: i'm.

30
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.229
Sally MacFarlane: I don't find it useful to review it this frequently. It might be

31
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.359
Sally MacFarlane: useful to review it less frequently,

32
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.670
Sally MacFarlane: and he talks a man,

33
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.470
Sally MacFarlane: I think we should. Uh, I remove that, because we generally skip it. Anyway,

34
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.849
Sally MacFarlane: anyone wants to until that.

35
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:15.269
Jason Frame: What's the twenty, two point three release. So I think I still some really work on creating a release range for that.

36
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.850
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah. So it should be two weeks from the last one. Uh where's our?

37
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.770
Sally MacFarlane: It's a

38
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.010
Sally MacFarlane: September twenty first.

39
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.140
Sally MacFarlane: The hacks

40
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.740
Sally MacFarlane: yeah, just over a week.

41
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.809
Sally MacFarlane: Oh, just over a week from now. I guess it's more than two weeks from the last one.

42
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.190
Sally MacFarlane: Um, but yeah, that's what it's playing for.

43
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.590
No one's names are down for the next three releases. So if anyone wants to

44
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.290
Sally MacFarlane: pop their name in.

45
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.229
Sally MacFarlane: Was there a particular reason You're asking that that?

46
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.670
Sally MacFarlane: Yes, because that's the next release. That was gummy up from the mainline.

47
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.890
Sally MacFarlane: Um! The others have been charity. So It' be good to get some of that

48
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.990
Sally MacFarlane: Chinese.

49
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.359
Sally MacFarlane: It was in the time of the

50
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.100
Sally MacFarlane: it.

51
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.569
Sally MacFarlane: Anything else.

52
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:17.019
Simon Dudley: Yeah, the I just wanted to point out. Um! I put a link in the chat. Someone pointed out that um Lgtm is getting deprecated, and I think that suggests that people move to Github codes coming.

53
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.579
Simon Dudley: Some might be something new on it.

54
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.580
Simon Dudley: The best approach,

55
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:31.549
Sally MacFarlane: I think. Github codes can He's already running because I was looking at some previous.

56
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.170
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, it's It's just,

57
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.560
Sally MacFarlane: hey?

58
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.630
Sally MacFarlane: Because, yeah, we might

59
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.080
Sally MacFarlane: even if it's already running the martin to turn off,

60
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.849
I subject to him

61
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.240
extra patches

62
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.050
Sally MacFarlane: being deprecated is a woman

63

64
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:24.260
Sally MacFarlane: Oh, thanks for that, I June it said the

65
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:32.099
Simon Dudley: they were using Github Code, scanning on Techie for a while, and there was a false of arms.

66
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.380
It was a great solution.

67
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:07.039
Sally MacFarlane: Yes, it also kind of general point of. Do we want to tie ourselves even more into Github as well?

68
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.949
Sally MacFarlane: If we are. An in the table.

69
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.069
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, yeah,

70
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.890
Sally MacFarlane: yes. The point

71
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.270
Sally MacFarlane: what

72
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.190
Sally MacFarlane: it could be a new record.

73
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.470
Sally MacFarlane: It's a

74
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.550
Sally MacFarlane: What was the previous record? I don't know

75
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.019
Sally MacFarlane: a good question.

76
