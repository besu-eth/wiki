Ry Jones: I apologize.

4
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.530
Ry Jones: for being late there.

5
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.580
Grace Hartley: I think I was later than one.

6
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.070
Grace Hartley: yeah.

7
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.660
Francesco Andreoli: I don't think that.

8
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.860
Grace Hartley: You were no.

9
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.510
Grace Hartley: will give just 30 seconds for everyone to join.

10
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.160
Grace Hartley: It did update the agenda i'll drop it in the chat.

11
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.190
Grace Hartley: and use the one from Tuesday.

12
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.010
Ry Jones: Okay you're the host so i'll let you control.

13
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.780
Ry Jones: Starting me.

14
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.750
Grace Hartley: Recording start.

15
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.490
Grace Hartley: hello, I will share my screen.

16
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:44.400
Grace Hartley: Welcome to the basic contributor call in a January 20 lift it back two days thanks for being flexible with that housekeeping.

17
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.100
Grace Hartley: here's the antitrust policy re seen it before.

18
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:59.940
Grace Hartley: The meeting will be recorded these middlemen speaking, if you have a question use the raise hand feature and we abide by the code of conduct.

19
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.290
Grace Hartley: No worries Daniel.

20
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:12.750
Grace Hartley: Few things on the agenda here kind of pulling in one to 10 on announcements were talking about the incentive program briefly.

21
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:32.340
Grace Hartley: Then we have metrics roadmap, these are two net new items from the conversations we had around continuing to improve the Community engagement and transparency, so I think this is a good so starting to put those in action release updates work updates other business open for future topics.

22
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.710
Grace Hartley: Anything I am missing or someone wants to make sure we cover in detail.

23
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.500
Danno Ferrin: We do this talk about tracing before we do the general announcements.

24
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.200
Danno Ferrin: and other work update trace APIs.

25
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.640
Grace Hartley: Sure yeah.

26
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.300
Grace Hartley: Are you only topic we could start with that now.

27
00:06:52.350 --> 00:07:00.660
Danno Ferrin: i'm just wondering I didn't put it on I hear that there is some work being updated to the tracing api's that had there were also looking at implementing the.

28
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.290
Danno Ferrin: The parody style tracing i'm probably just against the library.

29
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.510
Danno Ferrin: And I wanted to see if there is any.

30
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:19.590
Danno Ferrin: overlap if we're going to collide, and what we're implementing and if we could collaborate, you know what what the details on what what I guess a Korean step the task I don't know who's got the task there.

31
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:30.930
So currently it's Danielle who is working on that, and some people in Australia, so I sink Sally and someone else from her team.

32
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.050
Danno Ferrin: Because it's on the apac column wasn't.

33
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.890
Danno Ferrin: Just brushed right over so I guess i'll wait another two weeks and see what they have to say that.

34
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.700
Grace Hartley: We can also I mean.

35
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:58.110
Grace Hartley: feel free to text chat message i'm not a lawyer, so I get direct unfortunately sorry but yeah I think feel free to be like was working on this.

36
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.810
Grace Hartley: movie order and that will always not delay it for two weeks.

37
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:06.540
Grace Hartley: Okay.

38
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.880
Danno Ferrin: Now i'll just tag.

39
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.270
Danno Ferrin: Salim Danielle which Daniel.

40
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.390
Grace Hartley: Daniel Daniel learner.

41
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.120
Danno Ferrin: Daniel larimer in UK okay.

42
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.400
Grace Hartley: guys and speed, I think.

43
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.660
Danno Ferrin: In Spain Okay, but you're you're basically yeah exactly.

44
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.310
Sajida Zouarhi: cool.

45
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:45.630
Grace Hartley: Okay um next one incentive program update so uh the correction our team consensus reviewed at some, but we have to kind of go back to.

46
00:08:47.340 --> 00:09:02.190
Grace Hartley: Our team to kind of review it in detail the main action at this point, which is a Walker is hyper ledger and the E, F are working together to figure out what hyper ledger holding the keys would mean and how they would pull that off.

47
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.170
Grace Hartley: So that's kind of the so TIM couldn't make this call, he apologizes.

48
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:13.020
Grace Hartley: But that's kind of the the main Action point at this point for the two those two parties to work through.

49
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.320
Grace Hartley: That open questions so that we can.

50
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:24.030
Grace Hartley: You know, once we have that answer we're able to kind of move more into the details, but.

51
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.050
Grace Hartley: yeah that's about it.

52
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.260
Grace Hartley: Then next item is metrics.

53
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.620
Grace Hartley: So I dropped the insights in here I don't know if everyone can access this link.

54
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.900
Grace Hartley: Can every i'm going to drop in the chat doesn't mind just checking.

55
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:08.790
Grace Hartley: So anyway, so we promise it or we wanted to kind of use data to kind of inform what's going on with and evaluate what's going on with the Community obviously this is an awesome tool that.

56
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:20.850
Grace Hartley: One is foundations pulled together and help us kind of understand how the Community is doing so at this point, I think i'm just going to do kind of a quick pass looking through all of it but we'll kind of iterate over the next.

57
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.860
Grace Hartley: Few sessions to figure out what's most interesting to us and then go from there.

58
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.380
Grace Hartley: But yeah so we'll just kind of look through this together if that's all right, and then we'll.

59
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:46.650
Grace Hartley: yeah and continue to kind of be like what what's most interesting to us so contributor strength is kind of interesting so it's increased 800% i'm not sure exactly how this is measured here.

60
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.650
Grace Hartley: The growth in the aggregate account if you need contributors.

61
00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:08.850
Grace Hartley: So it's interesting that we saw a big jump between July and October, but we have not seen quite the jump between October and January 342 378-293-2354 that's that's kind of interesting.

62
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:21.420
Grace Hartley: we'll have to watch that period next contributor growth and retention so total contributors active contributors drifting away contributors.

63
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:31.710
Grace Hartley: want to see, so this is kind of the view of this, so it's kind of interesting because it shows back to them contributors and blue the drifting away contributors and Fred.

64
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.430
Grace Hartley: It seems.

65
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:48.570
Grace Hartley: It seems that are active contributors have slowly like a slow trend line going up, maybe again declining between October in January it's kind of interesting over the last three months we've seen kind of a.

66
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:56.550
Grace Hartley: stagnation and then again also seems interesting with drifting away contributors are also somewhat declining.

67
00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.490
Grace Hartley: look to see him going to like.

68
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:01.590
You.

69
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.900
Grace Hartley: just trying to see if I can like.

70
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.940
Grace Hartley: Do what that does sorry I should have probably done a test run of this before.

71
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.540
Grace Hartley: No that's that's just a photo.

72
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:23.880
Grace Hartley: Return rate is 14 point 26, so I think it'll be interesting, over time, we can kind of look at these and say you know, has you know.

73
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.360
Grace Hartley: Is the turn rate.

74
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:35.130
Grace Hartley: Lower higher why or why not we should be asking ourselves those questions to its growth.

75
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:46.020
Grace Hartley: and obviously anyone stop me or ask questions or comments on i'm just going to run through it commits growth, the growth in terms of aggregate account of total number of commits.

76
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.000
Grace Hartley: So yeah there's been a growth in the last three years, but.

77
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:52.950
Grace Hartley: I think.

78
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.440
Grace Hartley: be interesting to see the last six months what's happened.

79
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.530
Grace Hartley: which has been a growth of 10%.

80
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.220
Grace Hartley: I don't know if commits are as interesting as contributors, just because you know.

81
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.140
Grace Hartley: Depending on how big the commit is but still interesting to see.

82
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.050
Grace Hartley: You contributor grow, so this is over the last six months to be clear.

83
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.930
Grace Hartley: Total counted new contributors.

84
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.350
Grace Hartley: Interesting we had quite a few in September.

85
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:33.780
Grace Hartley: But it's kind of been pretty stagnant now so we could probably do a little better than encouraging those new contributors.

86
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.090
Grace Hartley: I wonder what does anyone know what we did in September, where we might have.

87
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.910
Danno Ferrin: A tpm and.

88
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.130
Danno Ferrin: I think we got a couple contributors from line chain, who were offering some of the changes, and I was approving.

89
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.220
Grace Hartley: cool okay that's a good point yeah because yeah it's.

90
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.920
Grace Hartley: Has anyone doing anything cool that we can brag about in the next month to.

91
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.820
Grace Hartley: To get people to to be to.

92
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.640
Danno Ferrin: something to think keeping my next month.

93
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.130
Danno Ferrin: yeah yeah yeah a lot of strange stuff.

94
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.120
Francesco Andreoli: yeah.

95
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.980
Francesco Andreoli: We definitely have the bounties least with this agenda for Denver, or something we kind of push.

96
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.410
Grace Hartley: The point.

97
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.640
Grace Hartley: commits by new contributors.

98
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.180
Grace Hartley: This one out.

99
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.120
Grace Hartley: interesting.

100
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.220
Grace Hartley: And really spiked who's the new contributor that's done all these comments in the last month.

101
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.760
Grace Hartley: Sorry, you just gave my candid thoughts here and then.

102
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.110
Grace Hartley: lines of code and it deleted I don't know if.

103
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.530
Grace Hartley: This is as interesting to us.

104
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.740
Grace Hartley: And the role distribution.

105
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.350
Danno Ferrin: September was the vm sykes.

106
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.010
Grace Hartley: yeah.

107
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.410
Danno Ferrin: it's funny yeah.

108
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:27.300
Grace Hartley: 76, so this is interesting so 77% of pull requests have been reviewed by the core maintainer is during the last.

109
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.090
Grace Hartley: Six months.

110
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.270
Grace Hartley: So it's kind of an equal distribution.

111
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.080
Grace Hartley: The.

112
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.510
Grace Hartley: code pipeline.

113
00:15:52.890 --> 00:16:00.240
Grace Hartley: This is kind of interesting around like so 11% of risky changes were caught in the review process I don't know if we would want that number to go up or down.

114
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.730
Grace Hartley: i'm.

115
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.310
Danno Ferrin: interested in other standard for risky changes.

116
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.210
Grace Hartley: yeah like i'm not sure how they're defining that actually does anyone have.

117
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.300
Danno Ferrin: 100% before it's March, to be honest.

118
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:27.660
Ry Jones: I don't know if the code for this particular part is public or not.

119
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.900
Ry Jones: But if you could.

120
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.390
Ry Jones: send an email asking your questions about that to the Community architects.

121
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:43.590
Ry Jones: alias I happen to have a two hour meeting with the team that's developing this today, so I will ask on that meeting.

122
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.260
Ry Jones: Like.

123
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.930
Grace Hartley: yeah because yeah just curious yeah.

124
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:50.250
Ry Jones: yeah.

125
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:59.760
Ry Jones: yeah yeah a lot of the the development is done in in private repos and I don't know what's public and what isn't.

126
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.500
Grace Hartley: And then.

127
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:15.450
Grace Hartley: One question so 7% of total changes or verge without any approval during the last six months, are we okay with that should it be zero well what are people's thoughts on that.

128
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:17.880
Justin Florentine: that's.

129
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.060
Danno Ferrin: Zero i'd love to know what those changes work.

130
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.530
Justin Florentine: yeah yeah Sam.

131
00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.530
Grace Hartley: there's a way that you.

132
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:36.660
Gary Schulte: might need just like merging of maine and too long the feature branch like that can merge branches merging main into it, that might be that could be some of those.

133
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:44.640
Danno Ferrin: that's i'm thinking i'm thinking is catching more than the main and the release branches it'd be nice if we could put a branch filter on some of these stats.

134
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.090
Danno Ferrin: Because merge is basically a collaborative.

135
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:48.840
Danno Ferrin: branch with.

136
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:56.430
Danno Ferrin: Not the same release standards so it's got you know doesn't have the same verge requirements, so I can see how that would impact things.

137
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.300
Grace Hartley: Okay, well, maybe ask about that one too right.

138
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.780
Grace Hartley: Or if we can get do you know how to actually is there a way for me to extract that just.

139
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.570
Ry Jones: don't.

140
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.900
Ry Jones: I usually I usually don't use this view.

141
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.320
Ry Jones: there's a detail view where you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.

142
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.390
Grace Hartley: Okay, so we can get a mess around with it.

143
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.220
Ry Jones: yeah if you look at the project reports that are.

144
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.030
Ry Jones: submitted to the tasc they usually have a link to the to the detail.

145
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.870
Grace Hartley: Okay i'll spend some time okay that, because that is interesting.

146
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.470
Grace Hartley: Interesting that.

147
00:18:54.060 --> 00:19:05.460
Grace Hartley: 80% of changes submitted for review were approved, I don't also do it because that, obviously, it makes sense that we want to improve everything and that's good that means we're actually reviewing things and not just letting everything go through.

148
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.500
Grace Hartley: But I again, I think we should be thinking about what what our target metrics.

149
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:18.780
Grace Hartley: Again we're just getting familiar with it at this point, but that's kind of interesting to.

150
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.030
Danno Ferrin: think the most important target metric we should track.

151
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:36.480
Danno Ferrin: Is PRS from non core competitors to make sure those get property view an astronaut, and I think that's we're talking about the funnel of changing users to contributors to maintain owners i'm.

152
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:47.070
Danno Ferrin: Not having your code taken seriously is isn't the barrier to that so if we review it is early you know, reduce the time to at least look at the PR and get some real comments on it.

153
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.620
Danno Ferrin: A lot of you know first time contributors their PR won't be you know, up to the standards because they.

154
00:19:52.950 --> 00:20:01.470
Danno Ferrin: You know, they may be documented, but they not may not internalize what's going on with what the code standards are for a lot of submissions so the quicker, we can get that process started.

155
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:12.000
Danno Ferrin: The quicker, we can like really minutes I can they get a bite on it on a fishing pole you got to keep reading them, so he looked at by and then you ignore it, for you know, two weeks, the fish is gone.

156
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:14.610
Grace Hartley: So let's look.

157
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.450
So.

158
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:24.330
Grace Hartley: Like you know, this is the PR cycle time which is kind of interesting to the total time start to finish his averages 8.92 in the last six months.

159
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.270
Grace Hartley: Meeting time to review pull requests, point two two.

160
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.370
Grace Hartley: that's pretty good right i'd love to see what say three months.

161
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.970
Grace Hartley: Point one nine wow it's even faster.

162
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.910
Grace Hartley: That seems pretty good to be right guys.

163
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.120
Grace Hartley: off base there.

164
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:11.190
Danno Ferrin: grabbing like to do some differentiation between what the stats to common core contributors, which is 80% of the commits, on the other contributors, we can.

165
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.060
Danno Ferrin: differentiate.

166
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.190
Danno Ferrin: Is this number high because we have a small group that always reviews each other's PRS.

167
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.120
Danno Ferrin: I think that's what can get missed by this overall metric.

168
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.700
yeah that's true.

169
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.360
Grace Hartley: Like that looks pretty good.

170
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.320
Grace Hartley: cool merge efficiency.

171
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.050
Grace Hartley: So we're looking at three ones, just to be clear and average of zero changes emerged after a month of being submitted.

172
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.480
Grace Hartley: But obviously that see.

173
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.370
Grace Hartley: Less than one day time to merge one to seven days.

174
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:54.420
Grace Hartley: More than 30 days so nothing that's good the seven to 30 is pretty low.

175
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.010
Grace Hartley: Think we've improved on that too there's been a downward sloping last three months let's look at the last six month you.

176
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:03.840
Grace Hartley: yeah.

177
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:13.020
Grace Hartley: Interesting yeah these are, this is really picked up the review of less than one day, and one to seven days.

178
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.820
Grace Hartley: In the last month.

179
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.050
Grace Hartley: that's great.

180
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:29.880
Grace Hartley: Then issues number of issues open issues unresolved issues so definitely seen quite a downward trend to be resolved issues over the last few months.

181
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.450
Grace Hartley: Okay, I will stop there.

182
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.780
Grace Hartley: And we can kind of keep.

183
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.340
Grace Hartley: Keep thinking about this and getting better.

184
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:57.960
Grace Hartley: What i'll do is hop back, obviously, if anyone wants to see anything particular will continue to get better at those understanding, but I think it's good to kind of see how the products performing overall it's kind of a fun tool.

185
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.330
Grace Hartley: But I know we have.

186
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:09.090
Grace Hartley: So judah has to jump at the end of the 30 minutes, so I wanted to give her two minutes to talk about the roadmap and just discussion on what's you know kind of look at what the Group.

187
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.480
Grace Hartley: Yes.

188
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:24.390
Sajida Zouarhi: Okay, so in terms of the roadmap, we have some main topics merge being the first one, and currently it's mainly about getting visual to participate in.

189
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:31.500
Sajida Zouarhi: To support us nets and for people to be able to participate to the nets using visual so we're looking to increase.

190
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:39.900
Sajida Zouarhi: Basically participation out say on these consumer he currently is the name of the destinies are being run.

191
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:53.460
Sajida Zouarhi: And we have a tutorial on how to join, that this nets using base when people were looking to do a turnkey docker compose so that people can even like improve the experience of doing this test that's.

192
00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:11.490
Sajida Zouarhi: Using our software so yeah so that's that's I guess what's going on with this topic and then for the day to day details Gary and justin and other in the team can can provide more info on the ips it's been not that.

193
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:23.940
Sajida Zouarhi: Everything is focused on marriage, right now, so we we had some prototyping done but it got delayed because anything that is not emerged related is D prioritize at the moment.

194
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.090
Then we have bonsai trees that were expecting to see.

195
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.110
Like to become generally be generally generally available soon, but.

196
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:46.590
yeah that's carry might have more info on that and then snapping is been you know progressing quite well lately.

197
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.410
and is working fine on glory.

198
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.800
Sajida Zouarhi: it's too early to say but earlier.

199
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:59.100
yeah because we didn't do the benchmarking, but it seems to have some interesting performance.

200
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:09.360
Sajida Zouarhi: Results so yeah and then client enhancement is kind of a category to put everything that is not his other topics.

201
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:24.330
Sajida Zouarhi: And currently it's media performance work updates and upgrades tracing things like that, and the last piece is me Vb zoo, which is also linked to a broader discussion that we need to have about.

202
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:37.050
Sajida Zouarhi: modules plugins, and all this kind of stuff, so this is something that we're trying to brainstorm more about at the moment and we will i'll publish something or somebody in the team.

203
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:45.030
Sajida Zouarhi: will publish something on the wiki so that everyone can provide inputs and we can start this discussion because we basically really believe that.

204
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:53.640
Sajida Zouarhi: by enabling by changing business, so that we can enable people to develop plugins and even have some challenges around that.

205
00:25:54.360 --> 00:26:06.690
Sajida Zouarhi: can prove contribution and also provide more features, to be able to be just a relevance clients, especially post merge and in meds like the first big topic that we can focus on.

206
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:09.120
that's it.

207
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:25.860
Sajida Zouarhi: So I did not, I did not put any non main that topic on this just because I don't know what's happening on the enterprise side, but if anyone has some input you free to an introduction.

208
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:35.220
Grace Hartley: yeah we can reach out to Sally and others to see if they can and that's the point.

209
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:37.110
Grace Hartley: yeah good idea.

210
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.280
Grace Hartley: But thanks for doing this.

211
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.260
Grace Hartley: This is great and helpful right so transparency any other questions.

212
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.100
Grace Hartley: Okay.

213
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.650
Grace Hartley: is enough.

214
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.860
Grace Hartley: Release updates.

215
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:04.230
Grace Hartley: Sorry.

216
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.920
Grace Hartley: Is this up to date, this is 2010.

217
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.500
Danno Ferrin: I think that's mostly up to date, so there was a lot of releases for Jay.

218
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.810
Danno Ferrin: And then there was a release for.

219
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:31.380
Danno Ferrin: dependencies I guess one of consensus as clients needed the dependency updates in the line and couldn't wait for the 22 one line release.

220
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:42.990
Danno Ferrin: so that you know just a lot of the scanning um if you're in classic kind of hard work that needed a timely update and if you're in classic they're just getting too aggressive with their work schedules, but.

221
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:50.940
Danno Ferrin: You know diego's willing to deal with it, so we got it out, and then there was a corresponding that was related to 2110 seven release which.

222
00:27:52.170 --> 00:28:03.090
Danno Ferrin: When we do this dependency updates that's why I like to have burnin so we can catch these rather than upgrading the dependency and shipping it as possible that's why back when I was still a consensus.

223
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:13.530
Danno Ferrin: During the quarterly updates on the first things we would do is update the dependencies and co operative were no more than one quarter behind any critical security updates so that's.

224
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:29.190
Danno Ferrin: What we got to do when we're against the wall, but that's no, we need to know sale has got a point on the automatic vulnerability scanning down further down the agenda think those are the things we need because we were using sneak before it's nice just not very good i'll just say that.

225
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.240
Grace Hartley: Any comments or questions on just the races or anything anyone wants that.

226
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:58.950
Gary Schulte: yeah it will say that the 20 210 we're talking about doing an RC three today we're wanting to kind of invert what we had been doing on the releases for the release candidates, as we were doing, along with feature branches and cherry picking into it.

227
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:13.200
Gary Schulte: And I think that that we had some discussion about it, it seems that it's going to make more sense to cherry pick into the prior final quarterly releases that we need, and then treat our seas just have them come off of main.

228
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:27.270
Gary Schulte: Just because right now we're in a situation where we're not releasing bain and it's not we're not we don't think that it's not really safe to I mean it doesn't seem like it's a wise idea to have both releases be off of.

229
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:34.950
Gary Schulte: Just off of head so there's not a prior release that that's that's viable so it's putting it out there that.

230
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:43.890
Gary Schulte: there's been some discussion about kind of inverting how we've been treating release candidates to have them be off of main instead of long live feature branches and we cherry pick into.

231
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:51.870
Danno Ferrin: Like it that's what I was pushing for a while ago um but one change request as we start calling them betas.

232
00:29:52.770 --> 00:30:07.230
Danno Ferrin: And when we do our seas that's RC applies cherry pick so if we start climbing the beta is only switched and quarterly release mode I think that's more reflective of the state and we start doing our season, we cherry pick into it so limit the the.

233
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.600
Danno Ferrin: limit to pull into it.

234
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:16.830
Danno Ferrin: That that was always one of my problems, was that the the dot one release was always a super release with a month's worth of minor changes.

235
00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.660
Gary Schulte: Right yeah.

236
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.720
Gary Schulte: yeah I think justin is looking.

237
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.580
Gary Schulte: into right now he's looking into.

238
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:34.230
Gary Schulte: Doing release modifications we've got some a devops engineer who's working on some some.

239
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:50.580
Gary Schulte: Release pipeline stuff so it's it's possible that we can make a change from RC to beta as I don't know know what kind of consensus would be necessary to to sort of change that naming but i'm it's functionally functionally it would be you know, just as I described but.

240
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.060
Gary Schulte: there's obviously some automation that we have to change but.

241
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:56.610
Justin Florentine: yeah.

242
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:03.810
Justin Florentine: yeah I would say we should just open up a topic on the release improvements wiki page that we've gotten that we've been working on.

243
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:17.250
Justin Florentine: thanks for your participation folks on that it is progressing, but I think you know we're not quite sure what actions are going to come out of it, yet, so I think this is totally reasonable to fold into that.

244
00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:23.010
Justin Florentine: Thank you Sasha she just posted the link in the zoom chat to the document I mentioned.

245
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.060
Grace Hartley: i'll just send the link in here.

246
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:30.690
folks.

247
00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.360
Justin Florentine: Thanks Chris.

248
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:52.950
Grace Hartley: Next steps we did the work updates we have follow up with Daniel and Sally so other business.

249
00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:02.970
Grace Hartley: looks like there was a change, Mrs guidelines, which was merged any other updating that.

250
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:07.290
Grace Hartley: think so.

251
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:24.570
Grace Hartley: hyper ledger chat task for so we had a meeting this week just for everyone's awareness here and we're putting together a proposal to move to discord were not that is not an approved proposal for the record, but that is.

252
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:30.600
Grace Hartley: it's either stay is is is what it seems like or our booth to discord and.

253
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:40.020
Grace Hartley: So we will keep you posted but hoping to get that finalized in the next couple of weeks, I think, realistically it'll be.

254
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:50.610
Grace Hartley: Part of the goal is to not just you know, have a proposal and say we should move, but also here's the migration path here's how we communicate it here's how we make it easy for everybody to do.

255
00:32:51.300 --> 00:33:05.040
Grace Hartley: Just so it's not you know kind of a free for all but getting closer so fingers crossed, and you can all keep me honest because i'm the person asteroids proposal, so if you pastor manifold definitely do it much faster.

256
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:08.760
Grace Hartley: An.

257
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.030
Grace Hartley: open forum.

258
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:19.440
Grace Hartley: looks like, there is the automation vulnerability scanning.

259
00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:31.890
Grace Hartley: looks like she's provided recommendation on the scan of docker image with TV.

260
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.160
Grace Hartley: So if everyone wants to take some time to look at that proposal that would be good.

261
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.540
Grace Hartley: Also, if anyone wants to speak to it more than I can do for you.

262
00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.110
Grace Hartley: All right, anything else any other topics.

263
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.180
Grace Hartley: People want to bring up.
