00:08:55	Sajida Zouarhi:	Same I have another meeting in 25min
00:09:53	Gary Schulte:	I had to dig around in slack, for the latest tracing convo I saw:
00:09:59	Gary Schulte:	we're have started work in Revenant on trace_callMany , trace_get and trace_rawTransaction but we are almost at the point where we want to see what's happening with trace_call, the approach to testing etc and see what overlap there is. It looks like @daniel.lehrner is still working on it but has been off sick
00:10:09	Grace Hartley:	https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/hyperledger%2Fbesu/dashboard;quicktime=time_filter_3Y
00:10:45	Gary Schulte:	Daniel will be tentatively be back on the 21st and we will have more insight into trace_call then
00:16:30	Sajida Zouarhi:	+1 for bounties. @francesco Is it ready though? We started the brainstorming but I think step one is to create a first bounty doc (gitcoin format would be fine) and get ppl‚Äôs feedback on it first, then we push it to Eth Denver and more publicly, then iterate on more bounties we could push in the future
