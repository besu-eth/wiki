00:24:10	Tim Beiko:	Maybe not since the transfer to HLF, but Besu has had a bunch of bounties in the past
00:24:40	Tim Beiko:	https://github.com/ConsenSys/protocol-BountiedWork/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed
00:51:40	Tim Beiko:	1. Does ConsenSys need live validator ASAP? If so, how much and whatâ€™s the setup? 
2. How to split the funds? 
3. Who runs the validators?
00:52:56	Tim Beiko:	4. It seems like everyone agrees to the multisig, but unclear who would be on it. Figuring that out
01:06:13	Danno Ferrin:	Also multis threshold.  2 of 3 or 3 of 3?
01:08:05	Sajida Zouarhi:	@Tim - if you have a number, how much $ value do 6 months of rewards represent?
01:08:27	Sajida Zouarhi:	My rough estimation (could be wrong) is 1 million dollars
01:08:48	Grace Hartley:	That's not trivial
01:09:03	Grace Hartley:	That's a lot of money that could seriously benefit Besu and the Ethereum community
01:09:06	Sajida Zouarhi:	Half of that actually, I was sharing my annual rewards total, so $500K
01:09:36	Sajida Zouarhi:	This is enough to kickstart a great bounty program and other initiative that could benefit Besu community
