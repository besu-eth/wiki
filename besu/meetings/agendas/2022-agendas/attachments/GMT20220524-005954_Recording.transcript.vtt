1
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.690
Hart Montgomery: Good I guess morning Sally how are you today.

2
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.510
Sally MacFarlane: Good how are you.

3
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.050
Hart Montgomery: Not too bad a little busy but that's life I guess.

4
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.260
Sally MacFarlane: wouldn't have it any other way.

5
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.740
Sally MacFarlane: Except sometimes.

6
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.010
Hart Montgomery: This is such thing as too busy but.

7
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.240
Sally MacFarlane: I guess we'll give it a couple minutes.

8
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.890
Sally MacFarlane: to join in.

9
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.320
Sally MacFarlane: Do you go to many calls like for other projects.

10
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.300
Hart Montgomery: yeah I do.

11
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.160
Hart Montgomery: some more than others, but generally I try to rotate around and go to a bunch just to at least.

12
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.080
Hart Montgomery: You know catch the pulse of things.

13
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.580
Sally MacFarlane: yeah.

14
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.360
Danno Ferrin: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, whatever it is.

15
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.820
Hart Montgomery: Good day.

16
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.980
Hart Montgomery: I had a random question for you Diana maybe Sally you can answer this to.

17
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.080
Hart Montgomery: Just a.

18
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.050
Hart Montgomery: a stream of conscious question.

19
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:17.400
Hart Montgomery: About across sort of all of the major theory of main net code basis how many external security audits, do you think are done annually.

20
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.390
Danno Ferrin: Low.

21
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.400
Danno Ferrin: Low to zero.

22
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.600
Hart Montgomery: Okay.

23
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.150
Danno Ferrin: I think basis, the only one that gets done.

24
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.660
Hart Montgomery: gotcha nobody else.

25
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:43.800
Danno Ferrin: So I think what they rely on is mostly their counties and effective at getting get audited no not audited, but you know secure by a factor of the.

26
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.510
Hart Montgomery: gotcha.

27
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.210
Danno Ferrin: And if we ended up hiring debs that way too.

28
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.900
Hart Montgomery: yeah It makes sense.

29
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.460
Danno Ferrin: But if they had audits they're not publicizing them I think basis that i've known i've seen an audit for.

30
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.270
Danno Ferrin: Mostly focused on the smart contracts.

31
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.680
Hart Montgomery: gotcha yeah no I don't just was curious.

32
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.780
Hart Montgomery: it's possible that people are doing audits and not publicizing them but.

33
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.990
Sally MacFarlane: Well, we might kick off.

34
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.740
Sally MacFarlane: Not super confident that other people can join me share my screen.

35
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.590
Sally MacFarlane: So.

36
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.000
Sally MacFarlane: housekeeping dancer just notice we're recording.

37
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.920
Sally MacFarlane: Please meet unless you begin and if you have a question.

38
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:12.180
Sally MacFarlane: So the first item on the agenda is about the incentive program and I copied in the notes from the contributed call two weeks ago in the other time zone, so I wonder, maybe hard, if you could talk us through that or if there's been any progress since.

39
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.680
Hart Montgomery: There hasn't been really a lot of progress it's on the desk of the higher ups at the lf.

40
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.750
Hart Montgomery: to sort of go over and i'm hoping to get it to the lawyer this week.

41
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.450
Sally MacFarlane: Say no action required from.

42
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.100
Hart Montgomery: No action required.

43
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.770
Hart Montgomery: You guys did a great job already.

44
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.080
Danno Ferrin: Did we need to identify the six deaths was like a little wiki page or something or.

45
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.490
Danno Ferrin: Was that SMS.

46
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.380
Hart Montgomery: yeah so that was a TIM ask, so we don't it doesn't need to be done soon, but.

47
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.370
Hart Montgomery: TIM wanted like he said it wouldn't be bad if we like got started identifying men that contributions.

48
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.290
Hart Montgomery: And you know we can basically put this wherever we want.

49
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.780
Hart Montgomery: But the idea is the ef wants it to be like a low lift for them to verify contributions.

50
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.670
Danno Ferrin: OK.

51
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:24.300
Hart Montgomery: So the idea is like you, like you, as a maintainer like say here's my name here's a link to my like my net contributions, and you know you can just link to the issues or the PR or whatever you want.

52
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.070
Hart Montgomery: So hopefully it's a low lift for everybody.

53
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.460
Hart Montgomery: like this solution seems to be the way to minimize the total work of the system.

54
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.260
Danno Ferrin: Right.

55
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.890
Sally MacFarlane: So that's what this is about wiki oh github.

56
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.370
For that yeah.

57
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.110
Hart Montgomery: So.

58
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.170
Danno Ferrin: And i'm wondering if we just tag our contributions may know.

59
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:58.860
Danno Ferrin: Maybe 10 the issues may know if we're doing like a non contribution like because one of the things that go into gets tracked as people spend a lot of time debugging consensus issues they don't necessarily write the code fixed.

60
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:11.700
Danno Ferrin: Absolutely, the data and it's hard to figure out, so the thought crossed my mind is if we just run a PR query and cross reference it with the main net tag that might work, but I don't think that will reflect all the people do.

61
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.990
Hart Montgomery: yeah so I don't yeah you're exactly right sorry to interrupt early there.

62
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.760
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

63
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.230
Danno Ferrin: we'll have to think yeah.

64
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.270
Danno Ferrin: Go ahead, something that just so there's a wiki page will integrate this right.

65
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.960
yeah.

66
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:43.140
Sally MacFarlane: yeah so we could use like a query on that made that tag that you mentioned, no to sort of inform you know refresh your memory on what you did in the period, but there could be other things that don't appear as PR issues.

67
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.720
Danno Ferrin: So when we get.

68
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.660
Danno Ferrin: meet expectations exceed expectations ratings and will always be set by the way, i'm projecting to Google.

69
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.310
Danno Ferrin: sites is.

70
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.900
Hart Montgomery: I have pushed yeah I have pushed for feedback from TIM.

71
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.430
Hart Montgomery: And he said he thought it was a good idea, but he wouldn't guarantee it.

72
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:21.450
Hart Montgomery: So i'm hoping that, like you know, certainly for anyone who thinks their main contributor, and the F says no i'm i'm hoping, they will get an explanation.

73
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.390
Hart Montgomery: Right, I think they like.

74
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.420
Hart Montgomery: In most cases, will certainly deserve one.

75
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.370
Hart Montgomery: You know I doubt world get any like strongly malicious people.

76
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.410
Hart Montgomery: So, like.

77
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.240
Danno Ferrin: But we need to be prepared in case they didn't show this watching.

78
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.500
Hart Montgomery: It but.

79
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.690
Hart Montgomery: it's already limited to the maintainer.

80
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.550
Danno Ferrin: list right right.

81
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.600
Hart Montgomery: So you have to be a maintainer of basic even qualify for this right.

82
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.520
Danno Ferrin: Right, we need to be long con.

83
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.810
yeah.

84
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.990
Hart Montgomery: You have to be I did all this work.

85
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.220
Danno Ferrin: out a card where it's just like it's so much work to just do it, why not just do the work.

86
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.260
Danno Ferrin: And stuff.

87
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.590
Danno Ferrin: A lot of money to steal that was just like gonna jog around it.

88
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.320
Hart Montgomery: yeah yeah so.

89
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:18.600
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, so I guess, there is an actual need to set up like a wiki page or an area to put in there.

90
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.990
Hart Montgomery: yeah and I think.

91
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:29.310
Hart Montgomery: People suggested that they wanted a staff an hf staff person to be responsible for this.

92
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:37.560
Hart Montgomery: For now we you know we can have someone do this, we just need to know where you all want it and how you want to handle it.

93
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.180
Sally MacFarlane: say.

94
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.840
Sally MacFarlane: Sorry hi john staffers and what would they do exactly set up the wiki area.

95
00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:02.400
Hart Montgomery: They could set it up and maintain it right, so I think somewhat grace or someone was worried that this would be a heavy lift for a maintainer.

96
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.570
Hart Montgomery: didn't I didn't think so, but.

97
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.130
Hart Montgomery: You know.

98
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.530
Hart Montgomery: it's a small thing, so we can have someone on staff like do it.

99
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:24.510
Hart Montgomery: But there was some discussion in the Community as to where this should be in sort of what format should take so it hasn't gotten done yet.

100
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.770
Sally MacFarlane: You mean whether it should be in the with the at all, just like what the page should be.

101
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:39.570
Sally MacFarlane: yeah.

102
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.690
Sally MacFarlane: So maybe we need a conversation, this is all we need.

103
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:52.620
Hart Montgomery: Sure yeah I mean if this could be just some someone proposing something and then.

104
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.440
Hart Montgomery: You know.

105
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.630
Hart Montgomery: People if no one says no, then.

106
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.730
Hart Montgomery: it's fine I don't expect this to be super contentious but.

107
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.590
You know.

108
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.920
Danno Ferrin: it's not contentious until TIM says notice something.

109
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.400
Hart Montgomery: TIM was fine with this so.

110
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:25.020
Hart Montgomery: I spelled out everything and gory detail and that document and TIM said it was fine so.

111
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.910
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, well, I guess i'm having to make a proposal if.

112
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:35.040
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

113
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:36.690
Sally MacFarlane: Okay.

114
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.490
Sally MacFarlane: Anything else on that move on.

115
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.470
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, thanks for the context.

116
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.140
Sally MacFarlane: Of course, the roadmap.

117
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.250
Sally MacFarlane: probably still needs updating, we have had a couple of new.

118
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.510
up and start.

119
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.980
Sally MacFarlane: In consensus on that, on the basis side of things.

120
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.390
Sally MacFarlane: But I don't think they have gotten around to updating the road mapping.

121
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.730
Sally MacFarlane: In the wiki.

122
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.210
Sally MacFarlane: let's just release update.

123
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.960
Sally MacFarlane: So 24 zero.

124
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:25.680
Sally MacFarlane: And 22, for one, have been done is next I think I checked yesterday that was not yet a volunteer to build that one.

125
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.490
Sally MacFarlane: That we still got a couple of weeks so.

126
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:40.710
Danno Ferrin: I can do it i'm also set up for the 22 seven those releases to get areas so i'm going to take the first star see on that as well.

127
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.230
Danno Ferrin: Yes, we're rebuilding a tool chain of 17.

128
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.950
Sally MacFarlane: Yes, yeah yeah appreciate that.

129
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.760
Sally MacFarlane: I think if you're down for that one out there's there's two spots in here, I think.

130
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.070
Danno Ferrin: We can get other people to volunteer so.

131
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.620
Thank you for the.

132
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.400
Sally MacFarlane: Thank you for that and.

133
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.900
Sally MacFarlane: What else So the message update again I copied this from the.

134
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.930
Sally MacFarlane: vehicle.

135
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:26.490
Sally MacFarlane: don't have any further than that, other than 24 one had the robson tdd config.

136
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.250
Sally MacFarlane: Then I do have anything.

137
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.630
Danno Ferrin: i'm sorry I didn't get lucky.

138
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.610
Sally MacFarlane: and

139
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.260
Sally MacFarlane: jogging yeah.

140
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:57.810
Danno Ferrin: um yeah it's it's cute cover teams on called a numbers, the details, I did listen to last operatives called the the shadow folks went really well enough that they decided to pick a date to fork robson and.

141
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:08.880
Danno Ferrin: This is a pretty advanced commitment only once, when they've started rolling stuff out to test that so they will live back and it's a pretty serious security bug to our back.

142
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:22.290
Danno Ferrin: So that they're confident this part that the only thing they might see is being blindsided by serious security issue shows a lot of confidence that it's going to happen in the next two to four months on main that.

143
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:25.980
Sally MacFarlane: Co.

144
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.720
Sally MacFarlane: snap think.

145
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.300
Sally MacFarlane: is also looking good.

146
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:44.040
Danno Ferrin: I read a couple times on my MAC mini right here it's really nice cream Center like a job.

147
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:53.070
Danno Ferrin: To work and working with cream and didn't even get a person I can't remember the names I probably have his.

148
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.920
Danno Ferrin: A Hamlet I only have his.

149
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.490
Sally MacFarlane: decide that.

150
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:57.780
Sally MacFarlane: A museum.

151
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.180
Danno Ferrin: Okay um we've been talking in another room working on some performance issues.

152
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.280
Danno Ferrin: To try and get even more performance.

153
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:12.120
Danno Ferrin: The short summary is there some changes we need to we can improve by changing put Winnie.

154
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:20.610
Danno Ferrin: To stop doing things that you'll do stuff with bulk arrays rather than doing it, one by one it'll do through mega morphic interfaces.

155
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:28.200
Danno Ferrin: So that's some of the stuff we're working on there, but it's getting to the point where we really need to take a long hard look at the data performance of rocks TV.

156
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.710
Danno Ferrin: there's a couple things we could do, I never was able to figure out how to do.

157
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:41.130
Danno Ferrin: The configuration on the rocks up to make it any faster, so we could look and see what other people are doing for their rocks db configs.

158
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:48.660
Danno Ferrin: Another concern I have is the Gemini might be slowing things down and it's been a known issue and we go through it so much and so often.

159
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:59.310
Danno Ferrin: That the Jay and I might be an issue, so we might want to like start looking at speculative things like a Java project Panama, and having build a bronze stevie this would involve.

160
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:12.810
Danno Ferrin: Doing somewhere config so we can run on Java 19 so john 17 so we still have to give a Java 17 backwards performance, but we could have are blazing fast deeds in a database that runs on Java right team.

161
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:25.920
Danno Ferrin: And that's if the issue is July that gives us might be config but I did a snap seeing just this afternoon and honest to goodness 50% of the time was spent in the database commit in read code sections.

162
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.410
Danno Ferrin: rehab we're getting we're getting a lot of good a lot of good performance which.

163
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.020
Danno Ferrin: works, a lot of good performance worked on this.

164
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:35.970
Sally MacFarlane: that's awesome.

165
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.870
Sally MacFarlane: cool sounds exciting.

166
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.510
Sally MacFarlane: I look forward to hearing more.

167
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:56.010
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, other business curated so i've just did a process for curators which previously were called non code contributors.

168
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:05.760
Sally MacFarlane: So there's a wiki page with that process i've posted it in the squad as well share it around to people who are directly affected.

169
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:14.550
Sally MacFarlane: But essentially i've also got another PR to basically rip that process, out of the maintain this process so that the maintain his.

170
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.820
Sally MacFarlane: process goes back to how it was originally it's just maintain, is it code may titans and the QA, this is an entirely separate process.

171
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:38.610
Sally MacFarlane: So there's a draft process there's a PR and along with that maybe to this tree current maintain owners who only need curator status so that's madalyn Murray, and so Gita.

172
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:44.280
Sally MacFarlane: So I think them and they seem to be fine with that and.

173
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.430
Sally MacFarlane: But there's a PR which I think still needs to wait, the two weeks for the vote as part of an internal process.

174
00:16:51.210 --> 00:17:02.760
Danno Ferrin: yeah it's that whole two week process like we just need a lightweight process, the Charter only speaks about people have permission to merge code yeah so we can do all this, within the context of the tree.

175
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:09.390
Sally MacFarlane: Great um, but I do think that the PR to change the process back.

176
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.150
Sally MacFarlane: still needs to wait, the two weeks.

177
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.860
Sally MacFarlane: yeah unless we get yes.

178
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:20.670
Sally MacFarlane: So yeah once that's done, then we should be lightweight and leaving So yes, thanks for your feedback on all of that done I.

179
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.410
Sally MacFarlane: will be good.

180
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:34.140
Sally MacFarlane: i'm going to skip metrics we still have this item here about having an off week discolored discord voice.

181
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.280
Sally MacFarlane: chat meetup I don't know if that's happened in your time zone.

182
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.010
Sally MacFarlane: or present a solution for that.

183
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:46.710
Danno Ferrin: It hasn't had a that had a very heavy schedule these past two months.

184
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.500
Danno Ferrin: As I think to cartoons also heavy schedule um.

185
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:07.200
Danno Ferrin: yeah I remember just We just need to propose a time it's not going to conflict with like standing seam stand ups another regular meeting, so we can just take it for now until after the marriage.

186
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.860
Yes.

187
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:25.980
Sally MacFarlane: And the last item that is Q, so we added kick you out static analysis, a little while ago and, for some reason I think last week it started just running out of memory, which is.

188
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:37.290
Sally MacFarlane: similar to what happened with that looks good to me one, so I did a similar thing added a config file specified and then we had enough fix the problem.

189
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.790
Sally MacFarlane: that's all I had did anyone else have anything.

190
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.430
Danno Ferrin: No nothing.

191
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.060
Sally MacFarlane: Short and sweet.

192
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.090
Sally MacFarlane: wait for the recording.

193
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.960
Sally MacFarlane: Thanks for coming.

194
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:02.820
Sally MacFarlane: Thank you, both.

195
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.390
Thanks.

196
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:04.800
Sally MacFarlane: All right.
