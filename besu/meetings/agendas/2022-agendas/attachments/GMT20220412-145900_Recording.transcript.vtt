Grace Hartley: kind of everyone.

18
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.030
Grace Hartley: We can probably get started.

19
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.350
Grace Hartley: Small favor Francesco Would you mind just yes yep up me to drop that in the chat.

20
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.930
Grace Hartley: I can kick off.

21
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.710
Grace Hartley: And thanks everyone for bearing with me on the APEC meetings lately, I have not been able to join them so thanks I know a bunch of people here and off the call have.

22
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.020
Grace Hartley: helped out with running them.

23
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.730
Grace Hartley: As my computer loads i'll share my screen.

24
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.540
Grace Hartley: Okay, so let's make this bigger because my computer decided to crash come on.

25
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.980
Grace Hartley: Now, no.

26
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.220
Grace Hartley: Thanks for bearing with me, slowly but surely.

27
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.640
Grace Hartley: Okay.

28
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.170
Grace Hartley: Thanks.

29
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:19.260
Grace Hartley: For once basin patients all right housekeeping address notice, please follow those rules everyone you're familiar but.

30
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:31.110
Grace Hartley: There is this meeting is being recorded, please mute or speaking, please feel for you feel free also if you have questions use the raise hand feature that's it's worked pretty well.

31
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.970
Grace Hartley: and

32
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.150
Grace Hartley: last one, at least, there is a code of conduct which I apologize not linked here, but please you know.

33
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.760
Grace Hartley: Also follow that as well and we're off general announcements so just a quick update on the incentive program update.

34
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:59.670
Grace Hartley: TIM is not on, but that's all right basically hyper ledger the E, F and consensus, have been working through kind of how to just set up the proposal number four and.

35
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:12.990
Grace Hartley: easy to use manner so we've been having different conversations around different agreements and how we kind of make sure you know, the funds and setup is working well there.

36
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.610
Grace Hartley: I guess.

37
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:33.210
Grace Hartley: Not there's nothing material to the distributions or the changes but it's looking like instead of kind of a massive one agreement the E, F is going to provide grants for every kind of quarter six month basis, based on the performance and the.

38
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:46.140
Grace Hartley: For the transaction fees and the withdrawal keys, so instead of being all kind of mapped out at the beginning there'll be able to kind of grant each party their own respective kind of grant every six months, which would be I think really helpful and.

39
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:56.250
Grace Hartley: Maybe take a little bit less of a burden hyper ledger but all of the content remains the same just maybe a different structure that we were thinking of how to implement it.

40
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:03.630
Grace Hartley: We have it so anyway still under still underway and hoping to get that finalized over the next couple weeks.

41
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:12.780
Grace Hartley: So these are kind of a couple of action items from a couple calls ago, so I apologize I don't know if it's been updated but.

42
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.670
Grace Hartley: So one is you know, we want to improve the.

43
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.340
Grace Hartley: Release updates, I think we can skip option to for orders of magnitude containers but um.

44
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:31.950
Grace Hartley: Release updates and improvements generally, we agreed to improve this process how has there been any updates basically speed on kind of the.

45
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:41.730
Grace Hartley: Release you know process and how have we been kind of have we done anything to kind of improve it looks like there's maybe a release rotation so maybe that's what this.

46
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:59.370
Grace Hartley: Is this kind of what we've been working on to improve our release processes has anyone seen an improvement it gotten worse, have you all been talking about it apologies I haven't been to the conversations.

47
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.120
Justin Florentine: yeah no that's okay great hey this is justin I can kind of chime in here.

48
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.220
Justin Florentine: The.

49
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.880
Justin Florentine: Release process has been pretty stable and it's been.

50
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.650
Justin Florentine: I think a lot more simple.

51
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:23.430
Justin Florentine: I know that I have not been using any proprietary consensus tooling and the last couple of releases that i've done, I assume danna hasn't used that either, so I think.

52
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.660
Justin Florentine: we've kind of hit a one and a half hour.

53
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.310
Justin Florentine: baseline for executing these and.

54
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:40.440
Justin Florentine: I don't know you know what do we want to do next, do you want to kind of leave it as it is, where it's a little bit manual and a little bit freeform.

55
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.320
Justin Florentine: i'm I wrote up a bunch of stuff on improving it, but.

56
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.530
Justin Florentine: not sure how much that's necessary anymore.

57
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:53.700
So.

58
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.350
Justin Florentine: yeah.

59
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.330
Justin Florentine: I mean, I think that we have effectively remove the dependency of arbitrary tools.

60
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.260
Justin Florentine: still have that two person.

61
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.640
Justin Florentine: You know requirements for as emerging emerging PRS.

62
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:19.080
Danno Ferrin: I yeah I think the one experiment, I tried a few releases ago was to do it on a separate branch, and that was able to be executed fully in parallel, so, even if it was.

63
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:31.020
Danno Ferrin: You know, it takes a long time to read it, he can you know run one step come back a few hours later, get the approvals, and you can read it asynchronously what to agree on a particular branch so it's.

64
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:38.430
Danno Ferrin: It seems like it's it's becoming a de formalized process because we're losing the tool but it's still very repeatable.

65
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:48.540
Grace Hartley: Right, so it sounds like this is close just wanted, I mean I think that's great, I just wanted to follow up on that because i'm not sure it had been.

66
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.090
Grace Hartley: I know it was kind of a concern earlier this year, and just want to make sure it seems.

67
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.370
Grace Hartley: Like it's all that right.

68
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.820
Karim T.: And I think it would be nice to have.

69
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:25.470
Karim T.: On intelligence ws instances like that not only concern system bells can update is just nuts and again there's so many tall she's not.

70
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.130
Karim T.: I don't know what do you think.

71
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:42.510
Danno Ferrin: you're talking about the consensus nodes the Canary nodes that consensus maintains and runs on their own infrastructure.

72
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:51.780
Karim T.: Yes, yes, I think it would be interesting to move this can arenas to any parish ws instance or something like that.

73
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.900
Grace Hartley: What are other thoughts on that.

74
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:17.850
Grace Hartley: All right, go ahead.

75
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.090
Hart Montgomery: This might be something you would ask the tlc.

76
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.980
Hart Montgomery: If it's something that you all.

77
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.970
Hart Montgomery: decide, you want to do.

78
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.150
Hart Montgomery: which makes a lot of sense.

79
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.620
Hart Montgomery: But.

80
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.360
Hart Montgomery: yeah I would say it's probably worth having that conversation there.

81
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:47.820
Grace Hartley: I think the question is, what does the basic Community thinks that's worthwhile and we should investigate how to do that, if so, then we can go talk to the CAC right.

82
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.320
Hart Montgomery: yeah yeah totally agree.

83
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.600
Grace Hartley: So let's so I agree, but yeah let's just make sure what do you all think.

84
00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.100
Hart Montgomery: Oh sorry.

85
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.700
Hart Montgomery: Sorry, oh i'll say this is a bigger question that other projects are asking as well.

86
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:21.360
Hart Montgomery: This like can we have sort of can there be official hyper ledger test instances or test nets or or even test Apps there is Community is asking if there can be like a test wallet even.

87
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:29.550
Hart Montgomery: So this is a if this is something that you all think you want to do it's a great topic for a wider discussion.

88
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:37.440
Danno Ferrin: Is it areas even wanting hyper ledger to sign their android APP store application was that.

89
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:42.210
Hart Montgomery: Yes, an ios APP to and that's.

90
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.540
Hart Montgomery: it's a pretty big ask.

91
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.640
Danno Ferrin: Is I agree.

92
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.600
Hart Montgomery: it's pretty.

93
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.960
Hart Montgomery: There are a lot of worrying things.

94
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:56.670
You know, because.

95
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:07.620
Danno Ferrin: that's the same level of an ask of us, we wanted to publish to maven central with an official hyper ledger key you know hyper ledger need to hold the key and sign it yeah it's exactly.

96
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.710
Hart Montgomery: we're also really worried that people would just use a test.

97
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.320
Grace Hartley: doesn't so sorry go ahead.

98
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:20.130
Hart Montgomery: Go ahead.

99
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.120
Grace Hartley: doesn't make sense that, like I don't want to.

100
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:31.320
Grace Hartley: cream putting it on the spot so say no wouldn't make sense to write up what would this look like.

101
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.530
Hart Montgomery: Absolutely yeah This is like a test.

102
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.200
Hart Montgomery: A test net or a test network is a lot less.

103
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.680
Hart Montgomery: Ambitious than.

104
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.950
Hart Montgomery: than like a signed wallet APP.

105
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.840
Grace Hartley: yeah this is yeah a little.

106
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.700
Grace Hartley: less of a.

107
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.190
Hart Montgomery: We go to a lot less of a task.

108
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.010
Hart Montgomery: So yeah this is definitely something to consider.

109
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.720
Hart Montgomery: And I don't know exactly what approval, so you would need.

110
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.360
Hart Montgomery: Or what we would need to do, but it's certainly a discussion that we should have.

111
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.660
Hart Montgomery: You know, probably even at a hyper ledger wide level, so if you all think this is something that.

112
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:28.200
Hart Montgomery: That would be really nice it would make a difference it's probably good to talk about that you know even the tasc meeting or maybe even the board.

113
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:41.850
Grace Hartley: cream, are you Okay, we just write up quickly like what what this would mean what this would take, and then you know share with the BC like in the basic contributors channel.

114
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:52.620
Grace Hartley: And that way we can you know iterate ourselves and then, if we think hey, this is what we really want to do, we can then share it more probably does that all right, or if someone else's right person, let me know.

115
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:53.670
Yes.

116
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:55.770
Grace Hartley: cool.

117
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:57.060
Grace Hartley: Thank you very much.

118
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.840
Hart Montgomery: This is a great thing to tie into like the CIV program to right.

119
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.250
Grace Hartley: yeah it's kind of another arm of it almost which, which is good.

120
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.940
Grace Hartley: cream, to provide right up.

121
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.690
Danno Ferrin: Do you want to bring this up Thursday or next Thursday.

122
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:26.610
Grace Hartley: I think let's get you the documentation right now and feedback just within the basic Community first and then and then so so propping up this week is my My guess.

123
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.390
Okay.

124
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:44.310
Grace Hartley: cool cool um last one, and then we'll keep moving is just I know we've talked about discord voice chat so if they happened.

125
00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:54.450
Danno Ferrin: No, I proposed a time that would be basically this Tuesday and I guess it conflicts with a chupacabra meeting, but I haven't heard a counterproposal for time okay.

126
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.540
Grace Hartley: let's maybe follow up again in the chat channel.

127
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.910
Justin Florentine: So we want to do it on the opposite weeks This call is that represents all right.

128
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.320
yeah.

129
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:17.160
Danno Ferrin: yeah basically the opposite week at the same time, it would just be on discord it wouldn't be recorded it wouldn't have an agenda.

130
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.820
Danno Ferrin: i'm my problem is it's.

131
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.690
Danno Ferrin: Half of my development team works in Bulgaria so it's also a prime chat time for them.

132
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:41.670
Danno Ferrin: Okay we'll see what works, I think we just need to start and and move it around and make sure it fits because what if there's a regular time I could block it out on my calendar and say sorry long chain I got other things I gotta do.

133
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:52.590
Justin Florentine: We can find out what came for 30 minutes instead of a full hour for starters, maybe that might make it easier to find a slot yeah.

134
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.480
Danno Ferrin: That sounds good yeah.

135
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.340
Grace Hartley: Okay let's keep moving release updates.

136
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.600
Grace Hartley: can speak to the latest it looks like this is really outdated dear.

137
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.280
Danno Ferrin: cut and paste from two months ago.

138
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:22.770
Danno Ferrin: RC one went out RC to predict calendar supposed to get cut tomorrow i'm for.

139
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.620
Danno Ferrin: The big exciting item out of.

140
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:34.350
Danno Ferrin: Is the rocks db upgrade we can run natively on em one Max without having to use rosetta that's kind of the big deal.

141
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:43.140
Danno Ferrin: So, and that also enables some speed ups and some cleanups from sinks and other.

142
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:55.410
Danno Ferrin: Other emerged related database cleanups that it really enables there too, so that's if the right time to go in for quarterly release to do a multiple jump for the rock stevie stuff.

143
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.290
Danno Ferrin: And who does on the calendar to do it, that is Gary.

144
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.680
Danno Ferrin: away rct that's going to be next week, the.

145
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:16.200
Danno Ferrin: So there's the release checklist and then there's the release rotation and release rotation list Gary is next week doing our cto.

146
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:23.940
Danno Ferrin: Which is to be Dr see one last week was it was really as it was wow yeah.

147
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.810
Danno Ferrin: Okay, so it's about a week away things look like they're.

148
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.440
Danno Ferrin: Depending on the schedule looking at their on the schedule this posted.

149
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:40.440
Justin Florentine: I think that's good having that extra week we are seeing some issues with the rocks TV we're gonna have fixes that should go into that RC so.

150
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:53.580
Justin Florentine: The tricky bit I mean Simon that tricky but just know that part of a few of us going to be def def connect Amsterdam actually should not be anything excuses from cutting out in our system.

151
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.880
Danno Ferrin: Is this yeah I didn't want to travel that week after Easter is Gary one of those people that's going to be there.

152
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.290
Justin Florentine: Yes, sir.

153
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:11.820
Danno Ferrin: Because I was tempted to put my name down was approved, but i'm not going to wake up at three in the morning to do it Ping me if you need someone to approve i'm willing to do it if i'm awake okay.

154
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.480
Justin Florentine: sounds good, thank you, Sir, I also be answered in with him so.

155
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.380
Grace Hartley: well.

156
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.950
Grace Hartley: sounds like we're moving on there and we'll be sure this is update for next time.

157
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.380
Grace Hartley: Work updates and.

158
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:50.070
Grace Hartley: Tracy APIs I know this is from a while ago but and then, but if there's any update will speak to please feel free.

159
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.550
Grace Hartley: I think actually.

160
00:19:53.640 --> 00:20:02.490
Danno Ferrin: I think that's done, I think this is old stuff so there's I don't know that there's much broke up data, other than the recent merge chatter.

161
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.550
Grace Hartley: yeah cool um.

162
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:14.790
Grace Hartley: merge update, something we just talked about the releases but anything kind of from awkward as you enter report back or otherwise.

163
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.770
Justin Florentine: yeah so merge show for one happened yesterday.

164
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.090
Justin Florentine: These two is unfortunately still sinking throughout it.

165
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:42.150
Justin Florentine: So it did not screw anything up, but it also wasn't really contributing to that effort moving forward so we're still waiting on that.

166
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:54.000
Justin Florentine: I think that's that's the major part of it we're finding small issues here and there was like a little ux things that people have run into.

167
00:20:54.690 --> 00:21:05.820
Justin Florentine: That have made their configurations more complicated that we're fixing so we're just collecting those issues opening in github and adding them as part of the project.

168
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:23.670
Justin Florentine: that's about it, as far as anybody got any questions as far as merge merge is concerned Gary and I are pretty deep into it.

169
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:33.180
Justin Florentine: And it's a lot of just kind of participating on discord and juggling stuff and reacting to things so that's why I don't have a real clear list of.

170
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.090
Justin Florentine: Major things that need to happen, but.

171
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.750
Justin Florentine: Any other questions, I can answer.

172
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:51.210
Danno Ferrin: So, was it getting the first secret bases that was a problem was it that was synced to win that shadow Forked it couldn't stay seat.

173
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:57.900
Justin Florentine: it's the first initial one setting it up, it took it's taking longer than we thought it was going to.

174
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.840
Danno Ferrin: Get snaps it's not fully functional yet.

175
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.580
Justin Florentine: Not enough that we want to unleash it on people.

176
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.350
Danno Ferrin: Okay.

177
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.280
Close.

178
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.460
Karim T.: Yes, I want to add some news about snaps think.

179
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:37.770
Karim T.: So yes, I can so I was able to finish minute and God synchronization with snap seeing on new with bonsai I need to test this for us, but I think it will not be complicated to as a company security risk for us.

180
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:48.780
Karim T.: Today, and doing some benchmark and trying to add some metrics to fix as a measure he officially can find and.

181
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.260
Karim T.: I think, maybe on the next.

182
00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:06.450
Karim T.: Meeting, I will try to share more information and I tried to manage the majority of PR in the main branch still one before having a usable snap sync.

183
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:21.030
Karim T.: feature on the main branch so when it will be mailed I will shells out on visit contributor, and if people want to test to find some issues, it would have to have a stable feature.

184
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:25.740
Karim T.: it's all.

185
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:36.450
Karim T.: Yes.

186
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:37.650
Grace Hartley: Thank you.

187
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:39.750
Grace Hartley: Thank you.

188
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.340
Grace Hartley: No questions it's going to update yeah and we'll have that.

189
00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:54.810
Grace Hartley: friendship we make sure to have just on the next call, I guess, would be the next call just be clear.

190
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.560
For.

191
00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.380
Grace Hartley: Kareem to spend some time on.

192
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.390
Grace Hartley: snap sync and walk you through it with the group.

193
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.310
Grace Hartley: And then.

194
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:25.320
Grace Hartley: I think that's it at this point for work updates correct me if i'm wrong so other business the I made security bought requests.

195
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.890
Danno Ferrin: Well, my put that in there, I I haven't followed up on it so i've got too much going on um so.

196
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.680
Danno Ferrin: yeah sorry.

197
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.950
Grace Hartley: that's Okay, what would be the next step is to.

198
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.790
Grace Hartley: give you a few weeks okay well.

199
00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:54.210
Danno Ferrin: i'm not sure that their request went anywhere it's just a you know, I was just trying to get ahead of it and be proactive and add to the requirements, so I mean it's something that I think could.

200
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.940
Danno Ferrin: Let me know when you're juggling and things fall to the ground and nothing happens, maybe it belongs on the ground so.

201
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.250
Danno Ferrin: So I don't know that there is a follow up action on this.

202
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:14.160
Danno Ferrin: Because we didn't I didn't get anything exciting, other than copy the existing dependent on other things which i'm sure it's going to be on the roadmap.

203
00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.840
Danno Ferrin: So there wasn't any high priority requests coming out of the team.

204
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.810
Grace Hartley: You know, high priority request that's fine.

205
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.870
Grace Hartley: And then I know nico's had some discussions on documentation.

206
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:39.660
Grace Hartley: I know this has been an ongoing for a while i'm just not positive what the latest is I apologize.

207
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.560
Grace Hartley: I think the question was basically around like.

208
00:25:53.910 --> 00:26:05.700
Grace Hartley: You know they're maintaining certain items on consensuses documentation separately and then wanted to kind of understand what the obligations are like what would make sense, because maintaining things in two places this challenging.

209
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.210
Grace Hartley: But I can follow up with him offline call.

210
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.310
Grace Hartley: or eight.

211
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.150
Grace Hartley: Then I guess we'll just go to the metrics and the room.

212
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.990
Justin Florentine: For something last minute into the other business category.

213
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.780
Justin Florentine: Absolutely, so we.

214
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:31.950
Justin Florentine: We haven't debug image of basic and i've had it for like three months or so.

215
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:48.660
Justin Florentine: I was helping somebody in fear a troubleshoot something or you're trying to use the debugger metric and they were going to use a command to do a dump and give john a flight recorder image of the vm and it's not taken it's not there anymore right.

216
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.380
Justin Florentine: Because the way that people package images these days don't include all the jdk.

217
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.260
Justin Florentine: And this has to do with the end of the modules that.

218
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.620
Justin Florentine: oracle's trying to trying to push.

219
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:13.710
Justin Florentine: And net result is kind of don't have a good solution have an image that has additional jdk tools on that.

220
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:24.210
Justin Florentine: What do people think about like does anyone have any ideas on how to solve that should be trying to like roll our own where we pulling down to individual tools onto the image.

221
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:38.280
Justin Florentine: Is that is there is there, somebody else to try to solve this problem that we can just reuse because it's kind of bizarre to me that it's that hard to put together an image that has you know more than just the jvm on it so.

222
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.240
Danno Ferrin: So, to clarify we're talking about a docker image right.

223
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:43.380
Justin Florentine: Yes, sir.

224
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.280
Danno Ferrin: Okay that's i'm not very good at docker.

225
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:55.680
Justin Florentine: yeah it's part of it, I mean the talking points probably not too difficult, I think the tricky bit is getting a distribution that has.

226
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.450
Justin Florentine: Taken man and the other, you know troubleshooting tools that you would need to get get up the jvm internals.

227
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:16.980
Gary Schulte: Is is it just not like a sort of joined late, I was on another call is there is not like a an alpine or an ubuntu distribution that has the you know APP packages for the jvm components, you want.

228
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.520
Justin Florentine: At packages.

229
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:21.900
Justin Florentine: Like I mean.

230
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:34.890
Gary Schulte: we're basing it off of ubuntu or off with Alpine we could just you know, in the docker image in the docker file update the repo pull down what we want and then prune out the the docker repo just to sort of build in the tools we want.

231
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:43.830
Justin Florentine: um so last time I looked at this, that was not a common thing and it wasn't places and Oracle was suggesting that people build their own.

232
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.590
Justin Florentine: Using using the modules.

233
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.350
Justin Florentine: Which sounded crazy to me it's sort of backed away slowly.

234
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.810
Justin Florentine: It sounds like we need to do more research.

235
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:09.030
Justin Florentine: So I just kind of wanted to surface that as a need and a bit of a step backwards from kind of where we were before since the underlying images were have been upgraded and it's going to be a problem for job 17.

236
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.800
Justin Florentine: Okay, thanks, Chris.

237
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:24.510
Grace Hartley: problem.

238
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.750
Grace Hartley: With that I guess you can go to.

239
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.780
Grace Hartley: metrics, as we said.

240
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.810
Grace Hartley: yeah that sounds good.

241
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:48.600
Grace Hartley: let's see how we're doing i'm going to update the.

242
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.380
Grace Hartley: Make it six months anyone have any issues with that.

243
00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:09.000
Grace Hartley: So running down to be your strength to increase six months has been pretty flat the last few months.

244
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.920
Grace Hartley: contributor growth and retention to the last six months we've had 115 contributors.

245
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:20.430
Grace Hartley: Is that right that can't be right.

246
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:26.010
Danno Ferrin: i'm.

247
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.490
Danno Ferrin: suspicious of how these numbers get me.

248
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:31.770
Danno Ferrin: shuns or contribute.

249
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.640
Grace Hartley: tours.

250
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.470
That must be contributions.

251
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:37.860
Grace Hartley: heart, please go ahead.

252
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:40.230
Hart Montgomery: That could be contributors, but it.

253
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.570
Hart Montgomery: It could be like a very liberal.

254
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:54.600
Hart Montgomery: contributor Count of like anyone who edited the wiki anyone who sent an email anyone who basically did anything, and these are also rife with over counts.

255
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.840
Hart Montgomery: So it turns out like.

256
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:12.090
Hart Montgomery: You know I had four separate fx accounts that I didn't know about so like if you're contributing on your gmail and on your work, email it's definitely get gets double counted.

257
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.790
Hart Montgomery: So.

258
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:28.020
Hart Montgomery: You know I suspect it's it is actually contributions but there's just a massive it's it's counting literally everything, people are doing and it's probably counting some people multiple times.

259
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:31.920
Grace Hartley: got it okay.

260
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:49.710
Grace Hartley: yeah I was like wait a minute as definitely not right or it's right but it's not how we would necessarily define contributor so Okay, and we will pass this one that doesn't quite make sense commits outside commits have slowly been growing as well.

261
00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.260
Grace Hartley: Which is kind of interesting.

262
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.930
Grace Hartley: Very fun last couple months but still kind of.

263
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.230
Grace Hartley: A slight increase.

264
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.170
Grace Hartley: New contributors.

265
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:14.130
Grace Hartley: So it's defined as someone who performed the first code activity and that has decreased it looks like we had quite a few increases in.

266
00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:27.870
Grace Hartley: January in February, but we haven't really seen as many kind of new folks, if you will, the last couple months any clue why that might be or any comments with a group on how we can be better about that.

267
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:37.590
Gary Schulte: The numbers are kind of kind of low even for a high we're only talking about 12.

268
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.670
Grace Hartley: X 12 X yeah yeah it might.

269
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.130
Gary Schulte: It might just be that, when we have that little bit of account on the metric that it shows wide variability.

270
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:53.670
Grace Hartley: yeah that's still yeah that's the point it's still not very promising go ahead heart.

271
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.840
Hart Montgomery: gracie do you have you all or anyone else you have any.

272
00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.470
Hart Montgomery: You know promotional activities planned or something like that.

273
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.640
Hart Montgomery: You know, it seems like.

274
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:14.280
Hart Montgomery: they're a bunch of things going on in the you know relatively near future with like a theory of everything else.

275
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:22.350
Hart Montgomery: That might be a good opportunity to try to attract some more contributors, I know, like David boswell.

276
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.050
Hart Montgomery: Does a bunch of.

277
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:32.610
Hart Montgomery: Has a bunch of contributors strategies so if you all want to go run like a contributor campaign, or something.

278
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.460
Hart Montgomery: it's definitely something worth considering.

279
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.230
Gary Schulte: These are just like code commit contributors new new.

280
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.520
Hart Montgomery: yeah the.

281
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:42.720
Hart Montgomery: The goal is to like what.

282
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.500
Hart Montgomery: You know, come up with a strategy to try to find new code contributors.

283
00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:54.750
Hart Montgomery: So I know for some projects, they have been highly successful.

284
00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:01.320
Hart Montgomery: Like they did one for bevel that at one point basically doubled its contributors.

285
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:07.320
Hart Montgomery: But it is also something that sort of what you put you know, the more you put in the more you get out.

286
00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:11.580
Hart Montgomery: You have your case.

287
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.800
Grace Hartley: That makes sense, I think.

288
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.740
Grace Hartley: it's Probably not.

289
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.270
Grace Hartley: A focus but it's worth kind of for the next couple months, while we're.

290
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.360
Grace Hartley: Making sure the merge goes Okay, but.

291
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:36.360
Grace Hartley: But I think you know there's obviously lots of kind of articles and stuff and different activities going out around around that and basically being a part of it so hopefully.

292
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:41.610
Grace Hartley: We can keep going.

293
00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:49.140
Grace Hartley: Can I yeah still decrease it kind of makes sense it's kind of been a little trending downwards, that would make sense.

294
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:13.380
Grace Hartley: yeah It just seems like there's a kind of a bit more activity, but it might make sense, because I feel like we're kind of actually have like new features or new.

295
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:15.810
Grace Hartley: New.

296
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:27.420
Grace Hartley: commits kind of the last couple like in February, March, April or February, March, but I feel like the last like month correct me from wrong, I feel like it's been more testing to kind of.

297
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:37.470
Grace Hartley: Making sure the things we've added haven't broke so maybe that that could also be a part of it, but that's totally until I have no filter.

298
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:52.020
Grace Hartley: For distribution think this is basically what it was pretty much a third, and third, and third, of a poor person editors and reviewers.

299
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.060
Grace Hartley: This is about.

300
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.600
Justin Florentine: We have more emerged and approved if that's something that comes up every time you look at this graph.

301
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.850
Grace Hartley: Well, I think that is it's the there's 3% right who that have not been approved.

302
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.580
Grace Hartley: That are March, it says that right, so that.

303
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.950
Gary Schulte: This has gotten better in the last six months, I think the last time we looked at.

304
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.660
Grace Hartley: This look at one year.

305
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:47.640
Justin Florentine: I think I think this is skewed because it's all branched off target branches.

306
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:52.350
Danno Ferrin: Right that's what it's still getting there was still the merge long the merge branch that it's counting up.

307
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.180
Danno Ferrin: Right so what's the three months, a.

308
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.280
Gary Schulte: year three months might have gotten better on the.

309
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.720
Gary Schulte: yeah which, without approval.

310
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:01.020
Grace Hartley: yeah here we go it's lips.

311
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:02.490
Justin Florentine: Okay cool.

312
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:08.250
Grace Hartley: 2% 2% yeah so it's it's improved that's good.

313
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.700
that's good to know.

314
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.590
Grace Hartley: cycle time I like this one.

315
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:37.530
Grace Hartley: So basically merge or pull request basically have a total of 7.83 days in the last three months let's see what six months is because I like to compare know we're getting better guys good job.

316
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:46.050
Grace Hartley: that's almost a day a half day less same thing, so in approval and review, so if your point five to 2.38.

317
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:55.500
Grace Hartley: Point for you two points so in approval it's a little X so that's good I think that's pretty.

318
00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.570
Grace Hartley: Anyone have I think that's pretty good, but anyone disagree.

319
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:16.200
Gary Schulte: I think we we put in place an expectation like a guideline that we for for more controversial or larger changes, we want to make sure there's at least a 24 hour cycle before we merge after approval, just to make sure that people have had time to the way in.

320
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:17.220
Grace Hartley: yeah.

321
00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:23.910
Gary Schulte: That might that might have a negative effect like it might be perceived as a negative effect in the future, but it's it's probably a good practice.

322
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.350
Grace Hartley: yeah good quality check yeah.

323
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.190
Grace Hartley: That makes sense.

324
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:30.960
Grace Hartley: merge efficiency.

325
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:52.560
Grace Hartley: I mean, so this is, I mean it's basically there couple that kind of joined all around the 7030 days to merge, but basically everything's pretty.

326
00:38:55.530 --> 00:39:00.750
Grace Hartley: resolved within seven days and I know big Spikes of like longer.

327
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.670
Grace Hartley: longer time periods issues backlog so.

328
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:10.740
Grace Hartley: open issues like we opened a lot last week.

329
00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:20.610
Grace Hartley: Relatively but resolve issues, I have a feeling, this will go back up it kind of it's good to see that they're a little opposite, but we don't want.

330
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:21.540
Grace Hartley: it to be.

331
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:23.910
Grace Hartley: contributor caught a look at how they kind of.

332
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:36.750
Justin Florentine: yeah we aggressively opening issues grey spammers really matter how small enough Okay, so I would expect to see this number, be a little bit higher than usual as we're using it as an engineering notebook.

333
00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:37.620
yep.

334
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:39.510
Grace Hartley: That makes sense.

335
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:48.930
Grace Hartley: But yeah and it will be interesting to see you know at the next call next few weeks, maybe you will give us just because.

336
00:39:50.130 --> 00:40:03.870
Grace Hartley: That also can help us, you know, are we able to close them quickly yeah maybe not you know, and if not, you know is that party and are ready to the March and how do you know, this might be a good just kind of sense check their.

337
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.690
Grace Hartley: issue resolution efficiency.

338
00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.080
Grace Hartley: Again, the folks you know it makes kind of sense.

339
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.920
Grace Hartley: None are taking 130 days some.

340
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:26.100
Grace Hartley: This is a little more fluctuate yep one, but you can see kind of a time to close for each of the issues.

341
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.340
Grace Hartley: or.

342
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.850
Grace Hartley: build staffing, this is a new one, is this a.

343
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.260
Grace Hartley: Successful builds builds or.

344
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:43.620
Grace Hartley: Have you seen this.

345
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.030
Gary Schulte: Number did it sit.

346
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:50.760
Gary Schulte: there to see a reduction of 1,500% does it, what does that even mean.

347
00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.470
Grace Hartley: New metric right I don't think i've seen this one.

348
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.980
Grace Hartley: Before I was.

349
00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.330
Grace Hartley: Trying to remember, I would remember this heart go ahead.

350
00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:07.320
Hart Montgomery: The lf metrics are very experimental I have no idea.

351
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:09.390
Hart Montgomery: Like.

352
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:13.770
Gary Schulte: This one is the one that's got me perplex tech any decreased by over 100%.

353
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:15.690
Hart Montgomery: I don't know.

354
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:20.130
Hart Montgomery: These other cell effects stuff is like very.

355
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:25.290
Hart Montgomery: You know.

356
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.540
Hart Montgomery: it's.

357
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.490
Hart Montgomery: It might be gone tomorrow that particular metric so I don't know.

358
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.000
Grace Hartley: that's all right now the.

359
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:42.180
Gary Schulte: metrics are cool it's yeah and not trying to throw stones it's just kind of funny at times.

360
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.130
Grace Hartley: yeah that's a funky one.

361
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.000
Grace Hartley: communication channels.

362
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.560
Grace Hartley: looks like 29.8 people.

363
00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:58.620
Grace Hartley: wonder who the point eight is.

364
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:04.800
Grace Hartley: skiing okay yeah about 30 people from participating the chat channel, I will say, I think.

365
00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.590
Grace Hartley: This is interesting.

366
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.260
Grace Hartley: You can see the chat messages.

367
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:14.940
Grace Hartley: I mean no doubt there's been.

368
00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.550
Grace Hartley: This isn't right.

369
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.720
Justin Florentine: Is that so pointing to rocket chat and not the score.

370
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.840
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

371
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:26.490
Grace Hartley: yeah.

372
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:30.630
Grace Hartley: that's not sounds like definitely see way more score.

373
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.050
yeah.

374
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.780
Gary Schulte: That would make sense, actually, this is that that does look like the chart of vs discord.

375
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.030
Grace Hartley: yeah all right we'll keep.

376
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:39.630
Grace Hartley: going.

377
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.490
Hart Montgomery: If you guys want to Ping right that.

378
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.490
Hart Montgomery: yeah I can do that.

379
00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:55.740
Grace Hartley: All right.

380
00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.710
Grace Hartley: Now, the last thing is the roadmap.

381
00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:11.730
Grace Hartley: judah or matt do you want to speak to that pulled up being cranky.

382
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:26.040
Grace Hartley: Maybe.

383
00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:40.680
Grace Hartley: question is around octaves.

384
00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.390
Grace Hartley: crushing so maybe it's me.

385
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:50.520
Grace Hartley: know just wanted to speak to the roadmap why just take a quick look at that there's anything he wants thanks.

386
00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:05.520
Sajida Zouarhi: So currently the Roadmap is pretty much dictated by the marriage activities so we're following on the shadow forks and generating activities.

387
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:12.630
Sajida Zouarhi: it's not going as smoothly as we would expect, so it has not been said officially but.

388
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.900
Sajida Zouarhi: merge might take some more time than.

389
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:17.760
Sajida Zouarhi: It.

390
00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:31.140
Sajida Zouarhi: Then it is working on the hive testing if i'm not mistaking the goal is to be suppressing all tests he's on the call he can give them more information on that, but yeah.

391
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:34.410
Yes.

392
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:42.690
Sajida Zouarhi: The goal is also to afford to snap sync we have early benchmarks currently I think carrying spoke to that.

393
00:44:43.950 --> 00:45:03.300
Sajida Zouarhi: Tests are still needed to confirm those results and yeah pretty much I updated, I think this last week so nothing new on my side and I encourage people that have other items that relates to the roadmap to add them, especially on the numbing net parts.

394
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.350
Gary Schulte: yeah i'll just add some extra color.

395
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:22.320
Gary Schulte: On the 22 for roadmap of 4844 we Daniel did a PSC on that which is going to be, which is the one of the options for.

396
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.080
Gary Schulte: lt cost reductions in Shanghai.

397
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.550
Gary Schulte: So.

398
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:37.080
Gary Schulte: has had has has had a PLC and 4844 has had a PLC bonds, I went GA.

399
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.090
Gary Schulte: snap sink is just there were so close.

400
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:58.350
Gary Schulte: yeah so I mean a lot of this roadmap where we're making significant headway on some at some of these items we've actually already already achieved and will be released or have been released already prior to 22 dot zero dot zero.

401
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.360
Gary Schulte: So we're doing well on the Roadmap is only one say.

402
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:11.580
Danno Ferrin: In the roadmap, based on what I see on our core does is very focused on the merge there's been some discussion of stuff going into Shanghai that's not.

403
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:21.240
Danno Ferrin: anywhere near finalized, most of the deals with the vm object format and stuff I have some partially working stuff I haven't publicly committed yet.

404
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.830
Danno Ferrin: it's getting the Elf stuff working in there.

405
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:34.050
Danno Ferrin: Because there's still a lot of up and down and what's going to do after they're going to disable self destruct Are they not going to say live are they going to.

406
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:44.580
Danno Ferrin: require validation for certain parameters certain ways it's still up in the air, so anything past emerge is still quite fuzzy to put anything beyond.

407
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:55.320
Danno Ferrin: To put anything concrete and roadmap so i'll do my best, I see the roadmap got updated and some of my old stuff I guess didn't get carried forward on that so i'll go ahead and update and put that in there.

408
00:46:58.530 --> 00:46:59.010
Justin Florentine: You know.

409
00:46:59.040 --> 00:46:59.940
Justin Florentine: Speaking of that.

410
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:14.190
Justin Florentine: Last last all court deaths, there was a question thrown out as to whether or not folks wanted to continue talking about things that were flagged to see if I consider for inclusion for Shanghai release right after the merge.

411
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:22.560
Justin Florentine: I didn't want to speak for all the bases I didn't say anything but I feel like my plates pretty full with with merge related things and.

412
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:39.450
Justin Florentine: The context ship to consider and to think through cf eyes is probably not something I have at the moment, what does everybody else think like think about that I i'm a mind to just say no let's just hold off until the merge before we continue considering new media piece of poet.

413
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:50.220
Danno Ferrin: I generally don't jump in those all productive conversations, unless I have some unique perspective on what my opinions are there by other people I just tend to be quiet.

414
00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:58.830
Danno Ferrin: And I agree that the merge is filling everyone's play that and to give any serious thought about Shanghai is putting the cart before the horse there's.

415
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.040
Danno Ferrin: And there's a lot of.

416
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:18.060
Danno Ferrin: People who feel like they're constipated with ideas they want to get into the vm that are being made lower priority than the merge stuff but, honestly that's you know with the correct assessment of the priorities mean we can't reboot the vm when we can't even keep a consensus layer

417
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:31.140
Danno Ferrin: yeah upgrade on track so it's you know there's there's people that are going to why we're not getting up Shanghai stuff there we're not getting the work done, but for theory main that I think it's the right call.

418
00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:33.000
Justin Florentine: Okay.

419
00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:43.590
Gary Schulte: anyone else, so I saw the thing from TIM on CSI, I really didn't understand what he was asking, because that that the we you know already.

420
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:49.440
Gary Schulte: As part of the awkward deaths caused have had these conversations about.

421
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:55.470
Gary Schulte: considerations for inclusion is advocating for change is the advocating for.

422
00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:59.280
Justin Florentine: Continuation nicely asking he's nicely asking whether or not they should shut up.

423
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:07.140
Justin Florentine: he's basically saying, are all these conversations a distraction, to the merge and do y'all have the bandwidth to consider you know brand new Ai PS.

424
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.810
Justin Florentine: You know, six months down the road.

425
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:20.910
Danno Ferrin: And I think anything that's in Shanghai that hasn't been proposed is not making it in So when I think we go to the Shanghai discussion it's going to say what have we been proposed and what can we get in.

426
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:26.310
Danno Ferrin: yeah it makes it work and only include things that are absolutely necessary because there's a lot of people coming in with these.

427
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:43.140
Danno Ferrin: crazy ideas like you know well let's reopen the idea to store gases a asset online the we could realize later because they're still salty they lost their gas token, and I think I do think it's it's TIM politely saying look you're not helping things.

428
00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:54.330
Gary Schulte: So okay if we if we wanted to if we wanted to signal support with him he's he's not he's not giving us any clues where he wants us to land so it's probably for the best but.

429
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:59.160
Gary Schulte: I would definitely appreciate some shorthand that would be in supportive.

430
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:02.460
Gary Schulte: Some sanity on that process.

431
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.070
Danno Ferrin: awkward as is this Friday right.

432
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:06.300
Gary Schulte: yeah.

433
00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:06.750
Yes.

434
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.710
Danno Ferrin: Okay, if the subject comes up i'll chime in.

435
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:20.940
Justin Florentine: I don't think it will come up no actually TIM reached out to us on the side and was just asking for some asynchronous feedback on that and I think his intent is to not have it not have it pop up.

436
00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:26.520
Danno Ferrin: He didn't bother me so yeah I don't know how to respond if he's not asking me.

437
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.170
Justin Florentine: hey.

438
00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:38.670
Gary Schulte: I think he's in the hyper ledger discord could we just respond in the hyper ledger discord and ask for it there's put an opinion out there and it's.

439
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:39.150
Gary Schulte: Literally.

440
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:45.390
Justin Florentine: Just clicking on it it's it's it's it literally clicking on an emoji response and the awkward deaths this discord channel.

441
00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.740
Gary Schulte: Okay it's awkward of all right.

442
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:50.820
Gary Schulte: yeah I thought the side channel that he had reached out yeah.

443
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.860
Danno Ferrin: Okay it's all Cortez that's falling off my radar because stuffs been fishing off of the table.

444
00:50:56.610 --> 00:51:03.120
Justin Florentine: yeah and like I didn't I didn't want to click an emoji signifying you know the perspective of the entire team without talking to people so that's why i'm bringing it on that.

445
00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.060
Gary Schulte: column and coming to a.

446
00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:19.230
Gary Schulte: shirt tabling of craziness if that's what we do to signal that, but it would be unfortunate to say we don't want to have consideration for inclusion.

447
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:26.850
Gary Schulte: You know post merge and and in the Shanghai time frame, so if it's a short term thing, and it seems like yeah align align unless crazy for now.

448
00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.250
Justin Florentine: cool thanks.

449
00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.010
Grace Hartley: yeah good question to.

450
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.600
Danno Ferrin: Which channel was it in.

451
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.020
Justin Florentine: I think it was an awkward as proper.

452
00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:41.880
Danno Ferrin: How long ago.

453
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.060
Justin Florentine: might have been last week.

454
00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:49.920
Justin Florentine: If you want no I can I can dig that up and send you the link to.

455
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.730
Danno Ferrin: It was on April fool's day and I kind of ignored everything on that day.

456
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:58.290
Danno Ferrin: Not that I was responsible for part of it, but.

457
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:04.890
Grace Hartley: alright.

458
00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:15.060
Grace Hartley: With that anything else from the group any other questions is open forum now.

459
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:29.730
Gary Schulte: He works natively on MAC in one now I have, I have my my development process and testing cycle has just gotten like half of the cruft is gone so i'm celebrating.

460
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.590
Grace Hartley: yeah that's definitely worth a PSA.

461
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.240
Grace Hartley: yeah.

462
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.560
Gary Schulte: That might be worth a blog post.

463
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:53.160
Grace Hartley: Actually that's great idea, yes.

464
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.380
Grace Hartley: For sure.

465
00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.180
