1
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.450
Grace Hartley: wow I did myself, I never do that.

2
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.550
Grace Hartley: cool, so this is a basic distributor call.

3
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.390
Grace Hartley: It is January 31 in.

4
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:40.680
Grace Hartley: The America has it is February 1 in a pack, so the APEC friendly call i've dropped the agenda in the chat, so I will share my screen for a moment.

5
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.050
Grace Hartley: I think we need to.

6
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.780
Grace Hartley: do this.

7
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.450
Grace Hartley: So housekeeping antitrust notice.

8
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:06.420
Grace Hartley: stakeholder look at it, I think everyone's familiar with it here means we recording as you saw please mute unless speaking, if you have questions feel free to use the raise your hand feature and.

9
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.250
Grace Hartley: code of conduct also take a look at that as well, which is not linked here but.

10
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.670
Grace Hartley: Also important for hyper ledger meetings.

11
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.150
Grace Hartley: Pretty straightforward agenda today with just basically one item if we get through the rest of it then amazing we can.

12
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:37.950
Grace Hartley: move on, but I have a feeling i'll probably take the bulk of the time which is fine it's important I know it's taken us a few weeks, get here so that's all right so anyway we'll be talking about the Center program and the proposal for.

13
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.020
Grace Hartley: Basically, how the vc community wants to facilitate.

14
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.290
Grace Hartley: will link to this one, for the record, there are there's this proposal that I shared.

15
00:01:50.910 --> 00:02:01.200
Grace Hartley: Late last week Wednesday, Thursday Tuesday i'm not sure, but I shared it there's also a proposal that Dana shared also last week called proposal 3.5.

16
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.590
Grace Hartley: Then yeah, so I think that's kind of the the just.

17
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.890
We see.

18
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.270
Grace Hartley: TIM is not here only just make sure they think he is critical to this conversation.

19
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.140
Grace Hartley: He has not responded to me saying in mind trying to get them on discord.

20
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.090
Grace Hartley: I can drag.

21
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.360
Grace Hartley: These.

22
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.010
Grace Hartley: rats.

23
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.020
Grace Hartley: Then I guess, we will proceed.

24
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.130
Grace Hartley: Without him.

25
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.480
Grace Hartley: Go Okay, then you will probably not go as far as I would hope, just because he is not here.

26
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.190
Grace Hartley: Starting at the top, so I think there are kind of a couple of differences that I noticed between the two, and they wanted to discuss those in particular.

27
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.100
Grace Hartley: And then we my ideas, we need to talk about those two items which I can put in the chat helpful.

28
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.490
Grace Hartley: And then would love to have us.

29
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.010
Grace Hartley: So this i'm just going to put this in jax clean.

30
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:55.770
Grace Hartley: First, one is just kind of the items of the organization's this current agreements, including I think they're two different takes on it and Dino and mind.

31
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:09.180
Grace Hartley: You want to discuss that to talk about the withdrawal keys, and then I would love for us to kind of then go into the guiding principles themselves and hopefully through the rest of it, but I think those are kind of the High Level items that makes most sense does that sound right.

32
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.710
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

33
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.920
Grace Hartley: Alright, so first up is.

34
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:33.900
Grace Hartley: is, I think the so this version obviously included just consensus hyper ledger and foundation a Daniels version included.

35
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.800
Grace Hartley: portal so i'm sure.

36
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.390
Grace Hartley: Sorry.

37
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.610
Grace Hartley: Yes, Sir, yes.

38
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.270
Grace Hartley: yeah.

39
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.690
Danno Ferrin: yeah if.

40
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.130
Danno Ferrin: you're open sourcing new stuff and.

41
00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:03.240
Danno Ferrin: there's a lot of other inside housekeeping and they need to do so they're moving everyone's with smaller cup two different company called scrolls labs it's not there for i'm sure there's lawyers can talk you through through yeah.

42
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.510
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

43
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.940
Grace Hartley: But just want to make sure I say that correctly, I think the original idea behind the program was.

44
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.470
Grace Hartley: To be just between consensus hyper ledger and the F I don't want to speak for him because he's not here, which is unfortunate, but.

45
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.120
Grace Hartley: I think.

46
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.120
Grace Hartley: In the current state.

47
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:34.590
Grace Hartley: I don't think the ef was okay with it another organization for now with that doesn't mean that can't change in the future, and I want to discuss with this group obviously you deanna and others to gain alignment there.

48
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.440
Danno Ferrin: With my concern.

49
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:53.880
Danno Ferrin: When only consensus is but in is is kind of putting up the Gold Coast saying this is consensus is territory stay out intentionally or otherwise, where the desk the intense that's the effect it has.

50
00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.630
Danno Ferrin: So that's why I tried to write it generically in terms of patrons and say that, yes, consensus is one of the patrons.

51
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.360
Danno Ferrin: But not writing out because some of the verbiage in there, it implies that only consensus is party to certain you know rights liquidation and only consensus.

52
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:19.650
Danno Ferrin: has certain privileges that might not be included other people who might come in later on, it really feels like it is still boxing off space for consensus that only consensus can play it.

53
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.140
Danno Ferrin: And that is the fundamental basis of my concern of all these agreements going forward is as long as.

54
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:34.140
Danno Ferrin: Only consensus is listed as the only party it's it's really continuing to drive a wedge between there's consensus contributors and not consensus contributors.

55
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:42.540
Danno Ferrin: And before this thing came out, we were making great progress and ever getting all sorts of great contributions from Diego I was able to do a lot of great contributions from that era.

56
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:52.950
Danno Ferrin: You know Ryan was looking at coming back and doing some of this stuff but now it feels like if you're not an employee, there is not work for you, here I mean whether or not, that was the intent that's how it feels now.

57
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.990
Grace Hartley: I definitely don't think that was the intent.

58
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.190
Grace Hartley: But I see your point, I think the.

59
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:22.110
Grace Hartley: wording here is is just to make it easier to follow it's not a at this point, it is only consensus, the F and hyper ledger better and the hyper ledger and consensus of the only ones that are going to be patrons i'm happy to you know insert patron and then.

60
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:30.240
Grace Hartley: When say current patrons are consensus and hyper ledger and there's kind of the guiding principle say the ef you know can.

61
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:42.480
Grace Hartley: stay there, you know or and it says explicitly you know they can invite others or and set up their own kind of guidelines for setting up an agreement with them, I think the concern is just.

62
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:51.120
Grace Hartley: Making it solving for the current problem versus solving for a hypothetical future state, so the idea by this.

63
00:07:52.800 --> 00:08:00.030
Grace Hartley: This current the agreement, I put out this week there was a number three was just to make it clear that this is the current state, but that doesn't mean.

64
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.780
Grace Hartley: And for clarity sake, not.

65
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:06.780
Grace Hartley: Not for.

66
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.590
Grace Hartley: Making it on welcome, but for clarity sake.

67
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:28.710
Danno Ferrin: that most of the changes in proposal 3.5 there's a distinct to it um I did do a gift on my personal space if.

68
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.460
Danno Ferrin: You want to review that and that's the fundamental difference Danielle do we can you say about it.

69
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:44.250
Daniela Barbosa: Now first thank you for doing that second I haven't been able to look at it until I pulled it up right now, and so I will look in detail, and then I just want to.

70
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.020
Daniela Barbosa: Just.

71
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:58.140
Daniela Barbosa: backup what grace just said, because I was on a call with the F and that was what TIM and I don't know if he's joined yet had indicated last week in our discussions.

72
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:08.730
Daniela Barbosa: So I just want to confirm that what grace just said is the same thing with with TIM and as i've said before, this really is a ef.

73
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:17.520
Daniela Barbosa: Project, you know program so they need to put the credentials in place and then we've been used to help support it.

74
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.540
Daniela Barbosa: But i'm looking at your.

75
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.850
Daniela Barbosa: or your at your document, now the one with the page history.

76
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.100
Grace Hartley: yeah unfortunately yeah we can't.

77
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.100
Grace Hartley: Without him here we you know, obviously you can't take our word for it, but so.

78
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:51.750
Grace Hartley: That was the idea is that, yes, this is the current state it doesn't mean the currency can't change and we could try to capture that in this of you know if new organizations, you know.

79
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.170
Grace Hartley: yeah so like I mean even got a principle here at 333 foundational will.

80
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:06.720
Grace Hartley: Provide feature will only provide future organizations that jump straight to support for basis may network access to the points will capital so.

81
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:16.890
Danno Ferrin: The key here is there was a discussion between consensus me up and hyper ledger knowing issues are out here and to know that no other retainer was invited that's kind of a good shot.

82
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.410
Daniela Barbosa: And it was with the F and.

83
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:27.960
Daniela Barbosa: hyper ledger and my and our Linux foundation lawyers as well and Ryan oh.

84
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.230
Danno Ferrin: By the way, it was called few minutes ago, I thought it was a three way meeting to meeting so.

85
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.060
Danno Ferrin: that's your meeting didn't happen like that, but it sounds like there was a three way meeting.

86
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.340
Daniela Barbosa: There was a meeting between the.

87
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.600
Daniela Barbosa: Linux foundation, legal and myself, and it was TIM and.

88
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.560
Daniela Barbosa: Ryan i'm blanking on his last name.

89
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:50.880
But.

90
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.370
Daniela Barbosa: Why am I black.

91
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.200
Daniela Barbosa: Ryan at the me see here i'll pull it up on my calendar.

92
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.050
Daniela Barbosa: They only put first names on their their emails.

93
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.790
Danno Ferrin: Right and that's that's really where.

94
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.480
Danno Ferrin: We started it was a three way discussion was only to me.

95
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.040
Grace Hartley: yeah um.

96
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:23.730
Grace Hartley: I guess, I mean like until we get alignment on that first point there's probably no no point in continuing.

97
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.910
Grace Hartley: cuz that's kind of the fundamental basis.

98
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.710
Grace Hartley: And I don't want to speak for him because he's not here.

99
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:40.350
Grace Hartley: So I think we could probably just move along in the agenda and continue this at another contributor call in the next couple weeks we'll make sure to enjoy.

100
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:54.030
Daniela Barbosa: i'm just looking just to make sure I didn't miss anything were there any additional comments from the Community on donald's proposal.

101
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:04.680
Danno Ferrin: There was a discussion in chat to Diego and Gary Gary made a good point that weren't respecting all me generous where we just doing lean.

102
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:18.810
Danno Ferrin: And tempt trying to do with because if yours, meaning that we only want to benefit, but that again falls into the same category of tim's not here to speak to his word, so I don't know if there's much worth going into without to represent the if you wanna.

103
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.410
Danno Ferrin: And Gary point that's what i'll say.

104
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.910
Daniela Barbosa: that's on the contributors.

105
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.320
Daniela Barbosa: chat correct.

106
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.400
yeah.

107
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.380
Daniela Barbosa: i'll go look at it.

108
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:41.940
Grace Hartley: yeah we will reschedule this, because without that first point of redefine without to me like.

109
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.020
Grace Hartley: Other fun stuff.

110
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:56.220
Grace Hartley: metrics with you so first of all, just I guess look into this, if anyone has any work updates obviously just government or you know when we can jump to that first.

111
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.670
Grace Hartley: But if not we'll proceed with the.

112
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:04.560
Grace Hartley: burnham show.

113
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:17.280
Grace Hartley: So this is the first time that he was many years so in case anyone hasn't seen this, this is the fx insights dashboard.

114
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.800
Grace Hartley: which provides some interesting.

115
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:29.010
Grace Hartley: Like just metrics on the contributor strength, so one of the calls, we had a few weeks ago, a month ago, something like that we talked about just you know.

116
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:40.500
Grace Hartley: bringing this up at the start of every meeting to see how the Community is working together see what you know and just be kind of metric driven on you know, on the open source.

117
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:50.970
Grace Hartley: Community item, so we will get better this we will review these if people review this on their own time and say hey we should be talking about this in the country radical.

118
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:52.860
Grace Hartley: Let me know.

119
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:59.370
Grace Hartley: But for now we're just going to do a quick rundown and we'll kind of get better over time looking at it yeah.

120
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:01.920
Grace Hartley: So contributor strength.

121
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:21.810
Grace Hartley: Slowly but surely we've been growing up, this has been a pretty consistent number over the last few years to be clear it's kind of fun to toggle between the different time so there's six months, for example, which is pretty flat.

122
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:30.540
Grace Hartley: And you can kind of see the different metrics from their active contributors in the last six months, you can see.

123
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:39.840
Grace Hartley: You can see kind of the trend lines seems to have more trending away or drifting away and.

124
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.070
Grace Hartley: People are joining so that's something to keep in mind for us.

125
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.550
Grace Hartley: To be welcoming to new computers.

126
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.730
Grace Hartley: Is commits again kind of flat little bit of growth 11% growth.

127
00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:00.660
Grace Hartley: And i'm just doing this quickly if anyone wants to spend more time talking about one just raise your hand.

128
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.770
Grace Hartley: There is.

129
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:23.160
Grace Hartley: This is new contributor growth again, you can see, in September, we had quite a few, I think that was from dana's em update, but again it's been a little pick up the last couple couple of months here.

130
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.210
Grace Hartley: This is cool commit to a new contributor, so it seems that we've kind of had.

131
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.280
Grace Hartley: You could argue, a trend line here, and it was going through the top.

132
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:45.270
Grace Hartley: With a little dip over Christmas, which probably makes sense and again will dip here, but overall, that I would say, actually this looks commits Many contributors that's.

133
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.300
Grace Hartley: promising it my my opinion.

134
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.090
Grace Hartley: You know.

135
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.220
Grace Hartley: Average churn rate.

136
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.930
Grace Hartley: And this kind of this is interesting go ahead.

137
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:22.710
Sally MacFarlane: I was just gonna say it would be interesting to know if there's a connection between like new contributors, and then you know, like whether they stay and contribute further so like maybe new contributors, is that their first contribution, or is that just.

138
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:31.950
Sally MacFarlane: don't know how that you new contributors as defined, but if if those new contributors stick around, and that would be interesting to know.

139
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:38.970
Danno Ferrin: There was a related discussion on the tlc call last week, trying to get drill down on some of these metrics mean, I think the street.

140
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:47.970
Danno Ferrin: There are some some semantics, the numbers that kind of communicate that but you know we have to read the help files to get the exact definition of what those are in, it has to do with.

141
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:56.160
Danno Ferrin: Retraining contributors and losing contributors cost three and how well spread out top 80% of your contributors are so.

142
00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:08.970
Danno Ferrin: Those are some of the some of the metrics that go in there and that again this is across all Linux foundation projects, not just hyper ledger so there's a lot of different Community measures they want to figure out for all of our communities.

143
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.060
Grace Hartley: yeah.

144
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:15.690
Grace Hartley: Great question.

145
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.280
Grace Hartley: yeah.

146
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:18.540
Sally MacFarlane: I guess.

147
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.510
Sally MacFarlane: I was just gonna say there's probably a number of contributors who can give me once and then never come back.

148
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.010
Grace Hartley: I think that's supposed to be captured in the.

149
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.380
Grace Hartley: ternary.

150
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:31.890
Sally MacFarlane: one.

151
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.330
Grace Hartley: Or is this one.

152
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.830
Grace Hartley: For the drift away one.

153
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.520
Grace Hartley: See.

154
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.680
Grace Hartley: I guess, this is a good one, but.

155
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:03.030
Grace Hartley: So I guess is the total number of drifting away, which is interesting it's not like 54 drifting away.

156
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.140
Grace Hartley: each month, you know I think this is cumulative right you sorry good.

157
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.660
Ry Jones: Sure, I posted a link in the chat.

158
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:17.640
Ry Jones: To the discord this course server for insights.

159
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:25.500
Ry Jones: Everyone is welcome to jump on there and start asking questions and start.

160
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:41.940
Ry Jones: Making feature requests and like they are very much wanting to hear from the community of users, that go beyond lf employees, so please go there, ask questions provide feedback.

161
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.590
Thank you very much.

162
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.020
Grace Hartley: And thanks for dropping the link will at those notes.

163
00:18:54.210 --> 00:19:00.000
Grace Hartley: yeah but so it's all good questions, I think we hyperlink are generally.

164
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:08.160
Grace Hartley: are new to this, even though the tlc so but you're asking the right questions and I think we'll get better and better over time.

165
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.740
Grace Hartley: This is kind of different roles kind of interesting there's a third, a third third.

166
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.450
Grace Hartley: code pipeline, so this is interesting so.

167
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:30.180
Grace Hartley: In the last six months, there were 583 commits 590 were submitted 505 reviewed for 78 proved and 502 merged.

168
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:37.380
Grace Hartley: 11% of risky changes were caught, which we did ask the question the last contributor go what is risky changes mean.

169
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:45.720
Grace Hartley: But that's good I would imagine and then 7% remote without approval which we kind of speculate it was probably.

170
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.400
Grace Hartley: You know Gary can could answer it or justin, but it was.

171
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.680
Gary Schulte: A feature branch for the merge.

172
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.820
Grace Hartley: Yes, yay Thank you.

173
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.650
Grace Hartley: yeah it was like branching I was gonna say.

174
00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.440
Grace Hartley: Thank you.

175
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:01.530
Grace Hartley: And then.

176
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.180
Grace Hartley: 99.4% of total change that support requests were reviewed word virgin to the upstream British.

177
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:19.110
Grace Hartley: yeah, this is one of my favorites This is my This is my actual favorite, though, which is a PR cycle time the sound of the average time it takes.

178
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:38.730
Grace Hartley: For PRS be reviewed and finally emerged, so you can see totals nine days so there's two days for it to be working progress for for to be in reviews the average time and 3.22 is in approval, so I like to look at this because the average reaction time across all the PRS was.

179
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:47.760
Grace Hartley: Just that was for the average time was to wait for two days, which I think is really great we haven't really been able to.

180
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.730
Grace Hartley: validate that but, but we should look at it across other projects and see if that's good or not.

181
00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:00.270
Grace Hartley: Maybe looking at six months was 9.31 days, what if we did.

182
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.090
Grace Hartley: Three months basically the same 9.41 days so we've been pretty consistent.

183
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:22.650
Grace Hartley: In approval 3.46 3.2 to maybe a little better, but this is very consistent across the last six months, which is interesting to and then merge efficiency.

184
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.690
Grace Hartley: And average 23 number of changes Roberta within one day.

185
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:38.910
Grace Hartley: being submitted, so you can see, less than a day this kind of is a cool trend line you could see in six months, definitely seems like that's our highest one.

186
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:55.380
Grace Hartley: And I think it's really great that there are no almost no more than 30 Dave reviews and then only a few and it's easy and it's our most number of seven to 30 days over the last six months, so kind of cool.

187
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.620
Grace Hartley: issues we definitely have been resolving issues faster than we've been opening them.

188
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.290
Grace Hartley: Over the last like month or two.

189
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.810
Grace Hartley: Maybe it means should we be.

190
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:16.290
Grace Hartley: Opening more issues or the is the Community just not opening issues or we just doing a great job solving all the issues, maybe it's the last one.

191
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:30.570
Grace Hartley: The meantime and then i'll just kind of fell through So this is the first time you guys are seeing this i'm pretty sure are in a detailed walkthrough so if there's something you want to spend more time on next time, obviously just let me know.

192
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.360
Grace Hartley: One fun fact is, yet this is the chat channel messages.

193
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:49.110
Grace Hartley: Something that I found really interesting the tlc call and if i'm remembering the data correctly was that are the basic and basic attributes channel we're like in the last six months.

194
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:57.780
Grace Hartley: The top two out of three channels being used in rocket chat so definitely seems like there's a lot of good conversation be done there.

195
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.570
Grace Hartley: and different commits from organizations.

196
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.130
Grace Hartley: 82% from affiliated 18% from individual contributors.

197
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.180
Grace Hartley: So yeah, so this is just kind of hot take going through.

198
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.970
Grace Hartley: Any questions comments.

199
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.250
Sally MacFarlane: And can you go back to the issues and versus issues being resolved.

200
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.130
Sally MacFarlane: Because I, I think.

201
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.250
Sally MacFarlane: Maybe the one before that.

202
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:51.540
Sally MacFarlane: It was issues to resolve this issue yeah so they've the lines have swapped crossed over in the last month.

203
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.580
Sally MacFarlane: which might be something we want to look at.

204
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.350
Grace Hartley: Is there a right answer.

205
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.910
Grace Hartley: Do we want more open issues are resolved issues.

206
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.120
Danno Ferrin: don't want to condition the unresolved issues trending up in when it's inverted that's what happens.

207
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.210
Grace Hartley: yeah that's true that's true yeah we don't want them.

208
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:28.710
Justin Florentine: yeah I would say, like that little hump over December 16 that's okay that's not a big deal, but what we're looking at here is the derivatives on those are scary.

209
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.110
Justin Florentine: Keep an eye on it could be, you know we're in a heavy design phase, and people are writing up a lot of tickets that are merged related, you know that could be part of it.

210
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.690
Justin Florentine: would be one thing to look for.

211
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:54.420
Justin Florentine: Looking to see that know a lot of peers, are they even attached to issues if we're doing a lot of stuff that's not attached issues, you know that could explain it to not necessarily bad thing, but explainable.

212
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:05.490
Grace Hartley: yeah I think that's a good maybe action for the next contributor calling two weeks just take a look at it see kind of if it's still trending up or maybe not.

213
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.880
Ry Jones: I will say I don't know the answer.

214
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:20.700
Ry Jones: I don't know if the these issues are sorted by like bug bugs or feature requests or whatever the tags are that you're using.

215
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:22.260
Ry Jones: and

216
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:34.170
Ry Jones: You know, for me back in the old days, what I cared about was the defined fixed rate, so it wasn't necessarily concerning to me if there was a huge spike in open issues.

217
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:46.470
Ry Jones: If the fixed rate on those issues by the person or people who were opening them was low if you're opening a bunch of issues don't get fixed that's that is not in and of itself a problem.

218
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.430
Grace Hartley: Good point.

219
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:09.210
Grace Hartley: Good well we'll keep getting better, and I think yeah good action item of kind of will pick things to look at next meeting that will be one of them look at the.

220
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:09.930
Danno Ferrin: issues and see.

221
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.850
Grace Hartley: A trend.

222
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.840
Grace Hartley: But I hope everyone enjoyed the.

223
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.560
Grace Hartley: graph show roadmap.

224
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:39.240
Grace Hartley: And we talked through this in the last meeting around the main updates Sally I think you were nice enough to update with the some of the enterprise features people and just speaking to those briefly if you don't mind.

225
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.060
Sally MacFarlane: I think there wasn't a whole lot to add.

226
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:52.530
Sally MacFarlane: yeah because a lot of the work that i'm non magnitudes of doing is not related to basic alignment.

227
00:26:53.670 --> 00:27:04.290
Sally MacFarlane: I did add something about moving privacy on chain groups out of early access to make it efficient production nature.

228
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:12.960
Sally MacFarlane: But that's that's kind of its work that's already it's a feature that's already invasive it's just a matter of you know.

229
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.650
Sally MacFarlane: pushing it up and taking all those boxes, to make it efficient production meeting feature.

230
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:20.940
cool.

231
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.400
Sally MacFarlane: And and oh.

232
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.530
Grace Hartley: yeah okay.

233
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.600
Sally MacFarlane: And I said I was also going to say that.

234
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:43.290
Sally MacFarlane: What our team is also helping out the main that team, but some of their work, because they're sort of more main network, then, then they can sort of handle at the moment, so we're helping out with.

235
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:44.670
Sally MacFarlane: That.

236
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.010
Grace Hartley: makes sense, make sense yeah.

237
00:27:49.950 --> 00:28:03.810
Danno Ferrin: yeah there's gonna have to set up its world class was going to be working on, we got some of our road mapping session internally in the past week I just haven't had time to come back to this roadmap on it i'm probably, let me tell him it's not over.

238
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.600
Danno Ferrin: So much screen of my own crap.

239
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:18.330
Danno Ferrin: It cutesy we're probably looking at doing some more performance work, you know, possibly getting some experience from.

240
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.780
Danno Ferrin: Seriously, if I can get my screens.

241
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.120
Danno Ferrin: i'm.

242
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:37.050
Danno Ferrin: losing everything so then we've got some contact with people who used to work on Java vm as far as performance and in creating the types which vm type on.

243
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.820
Danno Ferrin: languages like people who worked on the stuff for.

244
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:53.160
Danno Ferrin: because someone text him in the meeting still on who has a has a discord so I can talk to this, but they have two people in used to do National Park.

245
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.360
Danno Ferrin: and used to do some some.

246
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.190
Danno Ferrin: Comparison because.

247
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:05.220
Danno Ferrin: They worked on getting dashboard in it and print it so most people get employed in that so that's what these are looking for performance data in q3.

248
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:14.220
Danno Ferrin: I was looking at helping out on the other, Shanghai stuff and getting the vm container stuff because making sure that we can handle anything that's live the can spit out is very important to us.

249
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:24.690
Danno Ferrin: So that's something that we're going to put you know rigorous resources on right now, so as far as the configuration is to basically those are the the probably the two top ones coming out of skills labs in the next two quarters.

250
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.110
Gary Schulte: Am I unmuted.

251
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:44.430
Grace Hartley: You are unmuted.

252
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:54.570
Gary Schulte: Okay, Tim is on he says he's on the hyper ledger chat that's on the wiki page, I think the problem is that he has not that zoom link so i'll get them a link and he'll probably be over here in just a bit.

253
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:55.650
Grace Hartley: Thank you.

254
00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:02.610
Danno Ferrin: I lost all the screens on my second screen, so I think gets me in the chat for some strange reason, otherwise i'd be doing that myself but.

255
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:12.870
Sally MacFarlane: yeah we did an update the zoom link in the agenda, page.

256
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:14.280
Grace Hartley: that's.

257
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.110
Sally MacFarlane: Bad I apologize.

258
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.820
Grace Hartley: I should have done that.

259
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.260
Grace Hartley: I think I did it for the American that email this one.

260
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:30.870
Grace Hartley: But I didn't I didn't email him the correct link buddies other yes speak of the devil I do.

261
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.970
Tim Beiko: hey so sorry about that I thought the call was like 25 minutes from now.

262
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.010
Tim Beiko: I weren't running when I got your email grayson I I turned around me I couldn't.

263
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:41.820
afford.

264
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:53.250
Grace Hartley: very sorry no it used to be 9pm Eastern so that's totally understandable up no worries, we were doing some other business, since you weren't here.

265
00:30:54.810 --> 00:31:01.140
Grace Hartley: Just next steps on this rounded out is just I think Dana to update with with the systems items, but that would be great.

266
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.850
Tim Beiko: We can hop.

267
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.420
Grace Hartley: back to the Program.

268
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:22.530
Grace Hartley: So TIM, one thing that so we were starting with but realize you weren't here, and so it didn't make sense speak for you, so this agreement or so.

269
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:34.710
Grace Hartley: The idea behind the incentive program in its current state is to be with consensus and hyper ledger as the I guess patron organizations it's a good way to say it.

270
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.700
Grace Hartley: And there will be.

271
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:52.680
Grace Hartley: A few organizations, want to be considered the ef and hyper ledger can agree to ask them to it, but they won't be in this current one is, am I saying that correctly, please state that, however.

272
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.920
Tim Beiko: I guess maybe take a step back and like.

273
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.770
Tim Beiko: You know I read both proposals talked with.

274
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:06.720
Tim Beiko: A few some other consensus votes and then down to who wrote the proposal 3.5, and so I think.

275
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:15.480
Tim Beiko: You know there's there's two main kind of portions of the program like the recurring fees and the validator credentials, and I think when.

276
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:27.330
Tim Beiko: I think my general position is like when when thinking about the fees, it makes sense for people to be able to get access to the funds from those kind of very quickly, so you know.

277
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:37.410
Tim Beiko: I think they're kind of the requirement of of you know just working on stuff that that's relevant the main method and being a maintainer seems.

278
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:46.980
Tim Beiko: seems sufficient, and I think with regards to the withdrawal credential The goal of the program is really to provide those two organizations who've zero like.

279
00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:58.800
Tim Beiko: Significant supports towards the theorem a net and and plan to keep on on doing so in the future there's a whole bunch of you know, different ways, you can you can look at that.

280
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:06.150
Tim Beiko: But I like high level that's that's the idea I think today and also you know yeah organizations that like have done that.

281
00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:11.850
Tim Beiko: In the past, and like have you know sort of track record of doing it and kind of continuing in the future and.

282
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:19.890
Tim Beiko: I think today like when we when we look at just the different organizations, contributing to base you consensus obviously makes a lot of sense.

283
00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:30.540
Tim Beiko: Basically, was created there before move to hyper ledger has a large teams that were base you so that's you know that's kind of a no brainer from from our perspective.

284
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:40.260
Tim Beiko: hyper ledger obviously has been the home of hyper ledger base who and kind of the Foundation that's there to support it, and I think has like really stepped up.

285
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:48.510
Tim Beiko: Basically, ever since y'all learned about this program, so I think it's it's another kind of obvious one to to to add as part of that.

286
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:57.510
Tim Beiko: And I think then there's a question of like Okay, so you know in Dallas proposal there's like other organizations that are starting to contribute that have contributed for some time.

287
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:03.810
Tim Beiko: And you know if and how like you should be included from the get go, I think.

288
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.880
Tim Beiko: I yeah I think there's probably.

289
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:19.350
Tim Beiko: No other ones today that, like i'm personally really confident and included from the start, well, we can do for sure is you know provide guidelines and like.

290
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:30.810
Tim Beiko: rough kind of things that that we'd like to see to consider you know, allowing those organizations in the future, to have access to the the withdrawal credentials as well um but it's.

291
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:37.560
Tim Beiko: yeah I I do think it is like a kind of a higher bar that that those teams need to clear.

292
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:44.790
Tim Beiko: In rather than just like getting access to the transactions so that's my general kind of view on it i'm not like.

293
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:57.720
Tim Beiko: And I think today, it makes sense for consensus and he left to be kind of the two that you patrons but i'm not like opposed to having more in the future, as we have teams that are like contributing more towards me.

294
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:08.790
Tim Beiko: And and and I I do feel from like the conversations i've had with people it's probably on me at this point to make, like a rough you know list of of what that actually means.

295
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:23.910
Tim Beiko: But yeah you know, like it, I do think you want to require like a significant investment them contributing to main net from an organization before it can be kind of considered a patron and in like the terms of the proposal 3.5.

296
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.130
Gary Schulte: Can I ask a quick question about that does that mean that we would want to have.

297
00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.590
Gary Schulte: contributors.

298
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:41.280
Gary Schulte: that they have to go through a patron to participate in this, we would have to have somebody who wants to onboard and contribute has to go through one of these patronage or organizations.

299
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.180
So.

300
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.580
Tim Beiko: For what exactly.

301
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.040
Tim Beiko: To get access to withdraw credentials to get access to.

302
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.810
Tim Beiko: transaction fees or or.

303
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.270
Gary Schulte: transaction fees, just like the incentive incentivizing.

304
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:57.360
Tim Beiko: I don't think for transaction fees no like I think, so I think i've been talking with Ryan.

305
00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.330
Tim Beiko: Recently rise not rise, it still a maintainer.

306
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:08.070
Tim Beiko: Not part of consensus has like significant base of experience, if you wanted to come back for six months and work on you know some feature because he thought that was exciting.

307
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.830
Tim Beiko: I hundred percent think he should have access to like his fair share of the transaction fees for that period.

308
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:24.630
Tim Beiko: without having any affiliation whatsoever for example right, I do think you probably want to get keep on like being a maintainer so somebody who just comes in and it's not yellow maintainer.

309
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:40.200
Tim Beiko: Under especially today's like definition of maintainer were like a maintainer basically somebody who's contributed a couple of significant things to base you, so I think those should be absolutely eligible, regardless of whether the associated with a patron I think.

310
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:50.880
Tim Beiko: If you want to get access to the withdrawal credentials, then you know, by definition, you would like become one of these organizations.

311
00:36:51.390 --> 00:37:00.300
Tim Beiko: If there was a case where somebody was like an independent developer and whatnot but otherwise kind of met all the other criteria as we could probably work with them like I don't want to make.

312
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:10.590
Tim Beiko: The add like an paperwork burden around it it's really more about like kind of the long term, and like strategic investment in basic does that make sense.

313
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:19.740
Gary Schulte: yeah yeah I wonder if we could just like designate a hyper ledger or someone that would handle the unaffiliated.

314
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.460
Tim Beiko: Right, and I think yeah for transaction fees they.

315
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.160
Tim Beiko: This all assumes that hyper ledger can kind of process, some of the transaction fees and make.

316
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.930
Gary Schulte: distributions both.

317
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:45.030
Tim Beiko: Both out of like the the wallet of campaigns, but also, there is a 20% pool for hyper ledger which could pay bounties and stuff like that which obviously hyper ledger foundation would need to be to be able to manage.

318
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.050
Grace Hartley: Go okay.

319
00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:01.110
Grace Hartley: So, to be clear to him, for now, this is with consensus, the F and.

320
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.390
Grace Hartley: hyper ledger.

321
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.680
Tim Beiko: Right right like.

322
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.110
Grace Hartley: i'm just i'm just being really clear i'll just say it out loud.

323
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.520
Tim Beiko: I do yeah.

324
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:14.370
Tim Beiko: Okay.

325
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:23.760
Grace Hartley: cool and then just looking at the other guiding principles, just to kind of level set on those I think there's.

326
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:37.620
Grace Hartley: This, I think, number two is fairly straightforward this program offers these to nominate rewards, there are two types of rewards that we talked about later the transaction validator fees and withdraw funds, again, I think.

327
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.580
Grace Hartley: This kind of states again.

328
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:45.690
Grace Hartley: What we just said and then.

329
00:38:47.640 --> 00:39:01.380
Grace Hartley: The other one is, of course, you know any funds that it could be patriot organization consensus hyper ledger basically either have sole discretion on how to spend those funds assuming it beats the expectations of fun usage, which is from a net but.

330
00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:05.490
Grace Hartley: Are there any.

331
00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.140
Grace Hartley: Other concerns or comments on the guiding principles.

332
00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:22.380
Justin Florentine: You know the guiding principles look an awful lot like well a little bit like.

333
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.520
Justin Florentine: The protocol Guild.

334
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.070
Justin Florentine: That yes is putting together.

335
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.690
Justin Florentine: I TIM I don't know if you saw I floated this actually in the.

336
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:46.050
Justin Florentine: Protocol Guild discord as a potential option I don't know if you had a chance to think about it, but should we be maybe considering a proposal of you know validate or revenue goes into the protocol Guild.

337
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:54.090
Justin Florentine: And right, since that is an entity that is intended to you know reward people for working on main that protocols.

338
00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:06.300
Justin Florentine: i'd love to hear a way that we could do something like that, instead of reinventing the wheel and and making hyper ledger and this team have to divvy up those revenue fees every so often so.

339
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.460
Justin Florentine: yeah we're ready on that.

340
00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.160
Tim Beiko: So I guess just to give context about this um.

341
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.720
Tim Beiko: it's not explicitly that you have launch protocol deals but there's obviously.

342
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:34.560
Tim Beiko: You have people involved, but there's another initiative in parallel happening to figure out how we can get different dolls and and whatnot to reward contributors to a theorem both obviously kind developers but also researchers teams like celebrity and whatnot and and how we can get.

343
00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:43.530
Tim Beiko: yeah basically bows large projects and ecosystem for pred pledge a portion of their tokens to help fund public goods in the space, I think.

344
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:53.760
Tim Beiko: So I think the challenge with doing that, if say you wanted to redirect part of that is you're basically diluting yourself, which seems a bit a bit odd because.

345
00:40:54.150 --> 00:41:06.240
Tim Beiko: You know all all the theorem client teams have access to this program and the protocol Guild is aiming to include folks from client teams, but a whole other bunch of folks who work on my core it there and stuff that that.

346
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:15.840
Tim Beiko: may not be client teams right, so it seems a bit odd that, like you, would you know, for example.

347
00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:30.390
Tim Beiko: You know you send funds there, and like folks from nevermind are on that are on that as well, but then folks from nevermind also have their own programming like they're under no obligation to send phones they're like this is really meant for to find teams themselves, so I you know.

348
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:36.390
Tim Beiko: I think you could do it, but I don't think it's beneficial to base you to do yeah.

349
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:44.490
Justin Florentine: right if you imagine a world where all teams did that and the revolutionary effect was you know.

350
00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.380
Tim Beiko: it's still it still doesn't.

351
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:56.400
Tim Beiko: Work because, like say solidity is on there or say you know that, yes, I don't know if we have like an economics research team is on there you're still kind of deluding yourself and also we can't.

352
00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:02.700
Tim Beiko: We don't end like won't have the expectation throat or five teams that they do that with the funds like it's.

353
00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:07.170
Tim Beiko: Great I think it's really up to each team to figure out how they want to to split them.

354
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:13.140
Tim Beiko: So again, you know no objection if that's something you want it to do, I do think it's not like.

355
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.510
Tim Beiko: kind of economically rational for for for basic to do that if that makes sense.

356
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.640
Justin Florentine: Now here's a yeah.

357
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.430
Grace Hartley: yeah good question.

358
00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:25.320
Grace Hartley: Definitely can't.

359
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:28.650
Grace Hartley: Think about future ways to work with that, though.

360
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:35.730
Grace Hartley: cool i'm going to skip I think this is just kind of have to be clear on what the.

361
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:42.090
Grace Hartley: processes are I don't think there was many changes correct me if i'm wrong and Dan is version from this.

362
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:49.470
Grace Hartley: But just kind of aligning on verbiage, then the transaction fee, so there are three pools.

363
00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.020
Grace Hartley: The node operator.

364
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:58.170
Grace Hartley: The fun directly to hyper ledger and then 60% to patronage pool.

365
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:06.330
Grace Hartley: To be clear, i'm not going to get into all the details were there any questions or concerns with how this is currently.

366
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:13.140
Danno Ferrin: Working on hyper ledger cool we have an enormous ci budget.

367
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:28.110
Danno Ferrin: So, the reason I wanted at least that much earmarked was for us to pay for the enormous amount of time we're spending on circle ci it's larger than any other project and hyper ledger, so I do think a part of this should be going to pull in basis way on the services we're consuming.

368
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.210
Grace Hartley: yeah yeah I think that's that's.

369
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:44.220
Grace Hartley: Reasonable enough.

370
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:54.210
Grace Hartley: And to be clear yet, just like these are separate from any costs that are incurred by consensus, or any other patron.

371
00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:57.750
Grace Hartley: Particularly in the hyper ledger pool.

372
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:08.010
Grace Hartley: patronage fools something that's just just to be explicitly TIM hinted at or kind of said, but just want to be clear that patronage pool.

373
00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:12.120
Grace Hartley: And the withdrawal key pool will be.

374
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.400
Grace Hartley: determined by maintainer.

375
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:31.290
Grace Hartley: I think one thing that would be helpful, and we can maybe talk about this in a minute is just being clear that you know it doesn't make sense for any particular patron or any particular maintainer or whatever to be managing that list of containers.

376
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:40.950
Grace Hartley: For the patronage pool, so I think that would definitely be an ask on the hyper ledger staff side to have someone dedicated to managing that.

377
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.890
Grace Hartley: Just to be clear.

378
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.660
Tim Beiko: One sorry one comment that I definitely want to make on that Diego i'm.

379
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:59.520
Tim Beiko: i'm sorry I wasn't aware of your contributions on the base you chat like I do think you know this, like the stuff that you mentioned around the the libraries.

380
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:09.420
Tim Beiko: That were added, even though the classic and the benefit may net I do think that's like a contribution that would be worthy of like you know being counted, so I yeah.

381
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:22.260
Tim Beiko: I just want to make that fear and and again if there was a world where like etc co op hired a team to focus on a theory of main net and have that you know, like as part of the strategic goals, we could kind of have a discussion about that, but I.

382
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:36.000
Tim Beiko: I just want to highlight like yeah I guess the difference between the two is that the stuff you've done even though it's not directly like implemented at it from a net as long as it benefits based on mean, I think that should count towards a princess.

383
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:39.750
Grace Hartley: Go go ahead.

384
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:54.690
Diego López León: yeah steam the worries no yeah my my my question, there was mostly oriented on about the patronage, for I mean how we are going to hundred other I am it wasn't my intention to.

385
00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:06.570
Diego López León: imply that we want, I mean the corporate team to control some or one of their withdraw a kiss was just what about the access to the patronage pool.

386
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:14.160
Tim Beiko: Right yeah and that I think definitely should you should you should have access, obviously, assuming you keep contributing stuff that's that's useful to me Matthew.

387
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.590
Diego López León: Thank you.

388
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:31.440
Grace Hartley: cool good to point out, and then just and just saying this out loud obviously it's offer a 30 minute development work like TIM was just saying it's you know deals work would probably fit that bucket.

389
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.620
Grace Hartley: Then there's distribution of withdrawal keys.

390
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:37.560
Grace Hartley: So.

391
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:56.700
Grace Hartley: One just difference between the transaction fees and they maintainer the withdrawal keys is that withdrawal keys distribution is bait proportional distribution is based on the lifetime of over the entire program not just each respective.

392
00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.350
Grace Hartley: quarter.

393
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:00.810
Grace Hartley: Dana go ahead.

394
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.550
Danno Ferrin: So.

395
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:04.110
Danno Ferrin: This is why.

396
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:10.980
Danno Ferrin: I think it's important if we're going to get out of me patrons and is to get them as early as possible first off the first trash.

397
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:12.600
Danno Ferrin: Is five X, the next tranche.

398
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:21.330
Danno Ferrin: and secondarily if it's cumulative cumulative contribution you know someone comes in, and the third tranche is going to be, you know.

399
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:37.410
Danno Ferrin: Can consensus become a triple versus that distribution there, so I mean if if we're going to have people come in late this feels a bit you know dis incentivizing them because they're going to have like a one sixth claim on any of the tools and there's you know, like.

400
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.710
Danno Ferrin: yeah what a validators so I says.

401
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:46.590
Danno Ferrin: If that's the official position, then this I think she'd be revisited to be a more equitable arrangement.

402
00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:59.280
Tim Beiko: Right I I see what you're saying I think two thoughts on that one is, I do think it's worth like the first withdrawal with the first, which are all key distribution is not going to happen until the end of this year, basically when Shanghai happens.

403
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:07.980
Tim Beiko: And so I think there is time to work with other organizations that would want to be included That said, I don't think I would.

404
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:17.460
Tim Beiko: allow any org that's not a maintainer and base you prior to the program being announced to be part of the first kind of distribution so like.

405
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:24.420
Tim Beiko: Obviously, you know that oh your employer and, like other oryx who, who are already contributing i'm happy to like.

406
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:29.850
Tim Beiko: help make sure that if you do want to you know, invest in this and kind of be part of it.

407
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:41.130
Tim Beiko: you're not like missing the first tranche, so I yeah that makes sense again caveat is like somebody new that comes in, I think they should probably missed the first tranche, and we can get them on for a second one.

408
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:54.120
Tim Beiko: I also think, by definition, like it's it's going to take time for somebody like some entity to go from like having access to just the transaction fees to having access to the withdrawal credentials like.

409
00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:11.250
Tim Beiko: Just if we expect them to show and have shown like significant support that takes a while I do think we should probably like back wait like counter your contributions from the start, not from when you become part of the patrons if that makes sense, so say you know, for example.

410
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:23.070
Tim Beiko: i'll take i'll take strolled labs as an example that no but say, for whatever reason you didn't make the first distribution, but you made the second one, I would still count your contributions during that first period.

411
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:32.970
Tim Beiko: Because otherwise I don't think you can reconcile if you do have some sort of best in your time component for people to become like for these organizations to be.

412
00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:47.310
Tim Beiko: To have access to the withdrawal keys I just think it's fair to like reward them from the time they started contributing um yeah so those would be my two comments, but definitely agree that, like for folks who are here today and who who think they.

413
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.710
Tim Beiko: would like to be part of the first batch.

414
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:52.380
Tim Beiko: We can prioritize and try to make it happen.

415
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:59.070
Danno Ferrin: It be like say to pass through periods, because it gets really compounding your the end I mean.

416
00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.910
Danno Ferrin: You know we're talking about, not a question here again but.

417
00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.790
Tim Beiko: Right right so so the trenches.

418
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.500
Tim Beiko: it's yeah.

419
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:14.370
Danno Ferrin: So when I was coming in new we're looking for new people coming in means they may be too far down the road be concerned about it.

420
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:21.390
Tim Beiko: But I didn't I think like I don't know I would tend to count like from when they started having access to the transaction fees.

421
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:27.870
Tim Beiko: All the way to like when did you realize their first like period if that makes sense, so like.

422
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:40.530
Tim Beiko: For example, again i'll take like this will not be example like he say you didn't make the first batch but then you make the second one, you would definitely have counted for like the pre first batch period and the second.

423
00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:45.480
Tim Beiko: Even though you just gotta be the second something like that right like you.

424
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:49.710
Tim Beiko: I don't think we discount your contributions, trying to be like.

425
00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:50.820
Grace Hartley: activated yeah.

426
00:50:52.860 --> 00:51:00.390
Grace Hartley: So you're saying TIM like you know your maintainer pure like maintainer count counts towards you know.

427
00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:01.770
Assuming.

428
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.030
Tim Beiko: Assuming they're contributing to me nuts, but like from the first.

429
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:07.920
Tim Beiko: moment you've received a share of the transaction.

430
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.500
Tim Beiko: fees, I think, is when we should start completely.

431
00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:12.480
Grace Hartley: maintainer accounts can count.

432
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:13.440
yeah.

433
00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.500
Grace Hartley: yeah just want to make sure I was clear yeah.

434
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.390
Grace Hartley: cool Okay, we only have three minutes left I don't.

435
00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:31.140
Grace Hartley: Think there's anything I think there was drawing credentials, you know it's just you know that could set this can liquidate i'm sure i've been 30 minutes so.

436
00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:39.720
Grace Hartley: And I brought her in and whoever another patron opposition to the same, but there are some consequences towards liquidating just calling it out.

437
00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:51.780
Grace Hartley: I think there are some next step if the seems like we have general alignment on this, then I think there are a couple of next steps to call that one.

438
00:51:52.230 --> 00:52:08.010
Grace Hartley: which was him just writing up the like baseline that the guidelines for a net new organization coming in, which I think he's committed to and is comfortable doing, I think there then probably a handful of requests for hyper ledger.

439
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.230
Grace Hartley: One is you know, being able to be the.

440
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:20.010
Grace Hartley: One hold the keys to convey receive the funds and then distribute them out.

441
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:32.400
Grace Hartley: Three is if they can dedicate someone for their staff to help manage the program from their side and particularly.

442
00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.600
Grace Hartley: being responsible for maintaining the basic main list.

443
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:43.290
Grace Hartley: And then there's probably one or I have it written down only.

444
00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:46.950
Grace Hartley: Does it do those first few sound right.

445
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.580
Daniela Barbosa: Those three.

446
00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:53.010
Grace Hartley: Just three sound right sorry.

447
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.800
Grace Hartley: Let me pull up on, I had it written down somewhere, so I want to just make sure that's clear.

448
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.320
Grace Hartley: I think.

449
00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:20.280
Grace Hartley: And then I think actually the fourth one is just hyper ledger being able to commit to using the fun solely for basically we network, I know it's a part of the agreement, but I don't know if we've been explicit on that just yet.

450
00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:26.040
Grace Hartley: i'm happy to write these down to in the news.

451
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:26.880
huh.

452
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:47.070
Grace Hartley: But yeah, but I just want to make sure that's pretty cool Am I missing or those reasonable and accepts obviously will ask I know Danielle it'll take a little time a couple weeks i'm sure to come back and be able to save Roger can meet those items.

453
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:56.820
Daniela Barbosa: But uh well i'm hoping that'll be a little bit faster and TIM, I do have a follow up with you and just to let everybody know we are.

454
00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:12.120
Daniela Barbosa: Looking to bring in you know some Technical Assistant you know with staff new staff member that will be able to assist with some of these technical requirements around keys, and such so we're wrapping up some.

455
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:21.900
Tim Beiko: yeah I do think like of all the things Ray said, like the even if you're not ready to do it, but having the thumbs up that hyper ledger can actually custody and distribute crypto.

456
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:29.670
Tim Beiko: To me, that seems like the only thing where everything can basically fall apart like if that's if that's not if that wasn't true.

457
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:42.840
Tim Beiko: We would just need to find another organization, who can kind of have that role, and I think that's like much, much harder and everything else seems like a bit easier at the patch if if, for whatever reason it doesn't work out.

458
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:50.700
Tim Beiko: So I think if there's one thing to prioritize it would be just seeing if that's technically and like corporate operationally manageable.

459
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:54.450
Tim Beiko: And, and if it is like.

460
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:59.190
Tim Beiko: I think we're approaching something pretty cool um yeah.

461
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:07.470
Grace Hartley: I think i'll just say so, if we can get that the organization those two kind of for those five, I guess, one for you, for for 10 yella.

462
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:10.800
Grace Hartley: Items resolve the next couple weeks.

463
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:20.550
Grace Hartley: There is obviously i'm just going to transparently like obviously this has to go through all the organizations legal parties.

464
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:29.880
Grace Hartley: So I think this is the right spirit we will be transparent in that process, but just to be really clear that that is also a hurdle.

465
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.030
Daniela Barbosa: yeah just.

466
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.880
Grace Hartley: Was it with the group that that will have to happen to.

467
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:52.110
Daniela Barbosa: yeah and i'll just reiterate again when I said earlier, Tim you're on the call, but that the these discussions have been going on our last discussion last week was with me, you are lf legal staff and the theory and foundation, there was no other parties there.

468
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:54.630
Tim Beiko: yeah.

469
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:57.900
Tim Beiko: There was a call yeah yeah yeah I just want to be clear that.

470
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.930
Daniela Barbosa: The hyper ledger are working on these things directly.

471
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:14.700
Tim Beiko: yeah yeah and we're happy like I mean to just give general obviously if we're not pitchers politicians lawyers, but we can give general guidance that how we think of just these things from a legal and operational perspective at the yes and.

472
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.350
Tim Beiko: yeah hopefully help lead you down the right, the right path.

473
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:22.950
Grace Hartley: cool.

474
00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:23.520
yeah.

475
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.120
Grace Hartley: We are two minutes over to him really sorry to make you.

476
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:29.280
Grace Hartley: Know we're still on your run I apologize.

477
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:39.600
Grace Hartley: We I will put these notes in I have tried to capture everything, but please feel free to anyone add in or comments that I.

478
00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:45.450
Grace Hartley: misrepresented something, but I think, maybe a good benchmark is.

479
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:57.600
Grace Hartley: If we could have those items, or at least, as you said, into a field we told crypto the organization requirements by the next contributor call, then we can kind of.

480
00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:00.870
Grace Hartley: What is that is that.

481
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:06.720
Grace Hartley: it's two weeks from now two weeks, not this exact time two weeks, this idea.

482
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.760
Tim Beiko: Two weeks one hour ago is already.

483
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:15.750
Grace Hartley: Know two weeks it's America, Asia friendly time so it's like it's I will send it to you, I think.

484
00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.000
Tim Beiko: If you can send me a calendar invite.

485
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.970
Danno Ferrin: Like seven or eight in the morning, your time.

486
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:22.200
Grace Hartley: yeah it's a little early.

487
00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:25.050
Tim Beiko: that's fine I just need to know if it's seven or.

488
00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.590
Grace Hartley: 888 years.

489
00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.290
Grace Hartley: uh.

490
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:33.990
Grace Hartley: i'll add you to it now just.

491
00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:35.070
Tim Beiko: awesome thanks.

492
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:48.030
Grace Hartley: And then we will, I think, just yeah I think a good deadline is is just two weeks from now to be able to have a go no go have of those items at the latest Sally your hands up.

493
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:59.550
Sally MacFarlane: On a different topic on the agenda, there was an appoint about the hospital agenda chat task close being close to making a decision there any update.

494
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:08.250
Grace Hartley: There is, I drafted the proposal to move discord i've circulated with the task force, we have a meeting Wednesday to.

495
00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.180
Grace Hartley: Hopefully, agree to it.

496
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:27.600
Grace Hartley: But that is the current proposals to move all of hyper ledger to discord, we are not that isn't the final decision, but that is proposal that the team is looking at, but it's Wednesday, the proposals drafted the migration plan is proposed as well, so.

497
00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:29.820
Grace Hartley: Good question.

498
00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.610
Daniela Barbosa: we're all very eagerly awaiting the session.

499
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.920
Ry Jones: I spent hours, this weekend.

500
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.170
Ry Jones: trying to figure out how to programmatically make stickers so.

501
00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:49.590
Ry Jones: i'm really looking forward to it.

502
00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.830
Sally MacFarlane: It gets difficult.

503
00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.340
Ry Jones: yeah.
