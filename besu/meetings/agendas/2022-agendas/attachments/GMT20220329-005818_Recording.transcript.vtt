00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.260
Sally MacFarlane: hi frank hi hot.

2
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.550
Hart Montgomery: Hello.

3
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.910
hi Jason.

4
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.390
Sally MacFarlane: Give them a couple more minutes.

5
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.350
Sally MacFarlane: share the antitrust policy.

6
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:42.300
Sally MacFarlane: Alright, we might get started, so the antitrust policy if you're not aware and can read it from the.

7
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.790
Sally MacFarlane: Country continue our agenda and say grace can't make today's meeting so you're stuck with me for.

8
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.870
Sally MacFarlane: me anything.

9
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.270
Sally MacFarlane: feel free to.

10
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.220
Sally MacFarlane: Leave and watch the funding upwards, if you want to.

11
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:12.510
Sally MacFarlane: Please meet speaking and raise your hand if you have a question or something to say, and I will do my best to keep an eye on not.

12
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.390
Sally MacFarlane: um.

13
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.870
Sally MacFarlane: General announcements said this incentive program item has been.

14
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.920
Sally MacFarlane: Ongoing for a while I believe that's the.

15
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.950
Sally MacFarlane: Legal teams now so we're just.

16
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:37.830
Sally MacFarlane: waiting on an update from them, which i'm not sure how long that will take a visit and expected time for that part or anyone.

17
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.500
Hart Montgomery: yeah so i've been continuing to work on the hyper ledger side of the tip.

18
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.660
Hart Montgomery: I were moving forward slowly, I had a meeting with lawyers about a week ago.

19
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:06.510
Hart Montgomery: They asked for more specificity in the proposal so we're just flushing everything out.

20
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.650
Hart Montgomery: Do you have any questions for me about that.

21
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.920
Sally MacFarlane: or.

22
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.980
Sally MacFarlane: specificity on anything.

23
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.190
Hart Montgomery: I would say.

24
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:33.180
Hart Montgomery: pretty much everything so i'm writing i'm basically writing as we speak, writing up my own version of tim's proposal.

25
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.030
Hart Montgomery: That, I hope, will make.

26
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.360
Hart Montgomery: The lf Board and the lf lawyers happy.

27
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.900
Hart Montgomery: I, and I will ask this community for feedback when it's done.

28
00:07:48.840 --> 00:08:01.830
Hart Montgomery: Essentially, I think the F is is mostly used to working with startups and others who are very familiar with with crypto currencies and comfortable with them, and that does not describe the lf board.

29
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.890
Hart Montgomery: So it's just been a bit slower process, I think, but.

30
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.660
Hart Montgomery: We are.

31
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.930
Hart Montgomery: making good progress so.

32
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.900
Sally MacFarlane: So essentially filling in the blanks on some of the.

33
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.700
Sally MacFarlane: trends that are not wiping understood outside the group taking.

34
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.890
Hart Montgomery: Among other things, yeah.

35
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.890
Hart Montgomery: So, like I you know.

36
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:41.430
Hart Montgomery: so frequently one of the questions that i've gotten from the lf board is you know why isn't this just a typical grant.

37
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:57.930
Hart Montgomery: You know, and obviously the board doesn't necessarily understand you know proof of stake consensus and why they ef wants to structure the grant this way to incentivize validators to be run sort of all of these things.

38
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.450
Hart Montgomery: Does that make sense.

39
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.910
Sally MacFarlane: yeah.

40
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.890
Hart Montgomery: So.

41
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.120
Hart Montgomery: yeah This is just all.

42
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:21.300
Hart Montgomery: All things we've been working on, but you know we've got sort of agreements in principle, we just need to make sure everyone is comfortable with all the details.

43
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.040
Hart Montgomery: Thank you, let me know if you have any more questions or comments on that.

44
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:30.570
Hart Montgomery: If.

45
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.220
Sally MacFarlane: that's helpful.

46
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.430
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, so next item on the list is the roadmap review.

47
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:51.210
Sally MacFarlane: I checked the roadmap for this and it's a little bit out of date, so I think it's probably best if we just take this as a prompt for us to update.

48
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.100
Sally MacFarlane: Because it was last updated in February and.

49
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:12.510
Sally MacFarlane: So we've done 22 one release and 27 probably needs a bit of an update because.

50
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:27.780
Sally MacFarlane: yeah this this item has been done and it's probably a few things in there that we're aiming for that so um let's just take that as a reminder to the update right now.

51
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.090
Sally MacFarlane: So releases we've done 20 211 in February 21 two.

52
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.170
Sally MacFarlane: weeks or so ago, and then 21 three is shattered for the end of this week so.

53
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.890
Sally MacFarlane: Stefan is on the roster for for doing that one so is going to be.

54
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.450
Sally MacFarlane: really tough to do and it all.

55
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.050
Sally MacFarlane: depends on the phone.

56
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.930
Stefan Pingel: i'm on mute sorry.

57
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:11.400
Stefan Pingel: Yes, yeah it's gonna be off main and, yes, if anyone's got any questions or you know, like sent me a message oh.

58
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.440
Stefan Pingel: yeah.

59
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.460
Stefan Pingel: it's it's pretty straightforward.

60
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.320
Sally MacFarlane: Yes.

61
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.530
Sally MacFarlane: um yeah So this is the fortnightly.

62
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.340
Sally MacFarlane: releases that we're trying to make sure that we get out the door for.

63
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.700
Sally MacFarlane: New year's resolutions between 20 and then 22 401 and we wanted to a little bit of a gap between 22 and three and that first.

64
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:48.720
Sally MacFarlane: quarter right, so I think justin's on the list for that one he's not on the call but that's slated for next week um.

65
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.650
Sally MacFarlane: So yeah if there's anything that you want.

66
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.320
Sally MacFarlane: In that quarterly relates.

67
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.020
Sally MacFarlane: guess reach out to justin or.

68
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.930
Sally MacFarlane: stabbed, especially on on discord as ever, listen to this channel.

69
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:10.440
Sally MacFarlane: And then reminder about the release rotations page so it's.

70
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.670
Sally MacFarlane: As schedule that sort of always out for change, but.

71
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:27.750
Sally MacFarlane: As well as who's actually scheduled to do those places so let's try to share the water a little bit so volunteers welcome and also the release process improvements page which.

72
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:45.450
Sally MacFarlane: We do a lot of collecting of what we want in the release process and what we're not happy with right now, and I think we've sort of made a few tweaks but we haven't made the major jump to to basically says, which we're talking about for a long time.

73
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.970
Sally MacFarlane: So I think if if people have thoughts that page is still there, but.

74
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.810
Sally MacFarlane: we've sort of got a minimum viable process going at the moment, which keeps me going okay.

75
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.060
Sally MacFarlane: i'm work update so trace APIs.

76
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.970
Sally MacFarlane: They all got completed and they went in 22 I think.

77
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:23.190
Sally MacFarlane: So if if there's any questions or feedback that would be great and i'm not sure if anyone's on the call he can give us an update on the message.

78
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.760
Sally MacFarlane: let's get that one future future backwards incompatible changes say.

79
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:57.990
Sally MacFarlane: Java 17 migration, so this notice in the next quarterly that we're planning to do this, so I think that's something that needs to go in 2014 as a something that we plan to do and the.

80
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.450
Sally MacFarlane: One about the edm migration from JESSICA too long, I haven't looked into that one yet.

81
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.870
Sally MacFarlane: But I guess if you got any questions on that only the person to reach out to their.

82
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.250
Sally MacFarlane: A pause there for questions.

83
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.220
Sally MacFarlane: questions.

84
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:36.510
Sally MacFarlane: um so other business the documentation discussion, so this was something that I think that discussed on the last contributor call but.

85
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.000
Sally MacFarlane: Was there a resolution is there any action or discussion that we.

86
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:43.980
Sally MacFarlane: need to.

87
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.730
Sally MacFarlane: I might I might ask that question.

88
00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.340
Sally MacFarlane: So this was about not having consensus specific instructions for how to maintain the dog.

89
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.950
Sally MacFarlane: And the automated security by requests.

90
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.820
Sally MacFarlane: Hot or anyone can do this any context.

91
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.920
Hart Montgomery: I don't have a ton of things to add at this point.

92
00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.180
Hart Montgomery: This is a Dell fx project.

93
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.100
Hart Montgomery: But if you all have any suggestions.

94
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.390
Hart Montgomery: We can certainly pass those along.

95
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.440
Sally MacFarlane: So this is this sort of analyzing that we're not checking in.

96
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.920
Sally MacFarlane: Security secrets into the repos.

97
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.090
Hart Montgomery: No, I think this is more like.

98
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.480
Hart Montgomery: Are there you know, are there any hanging unclaimed mpm packages kind of think.

99
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.000
Hart Montgomery: This isn't like secret detection code I don't think.

100
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.780
Hart Montgomery: I think this is more sort of lower hanging fruit and it's more focused on.

101
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.110
Hart Montgomery: Release outputs than anything else.

102
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:24.810
Sally MacFarlane: Okay.

103
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:34.650
Hart Montgomery: But if you have suggestions, the the secrets in code thing is a good one, but unfortunately that turns up a lot of false positives.

104
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:44.670
Hart Montgomery: Because people right a lot of test cases and you know it's okay to hard code keys for test cases right in some cases it's necessary.

105
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.850
Hart Montgomery: But if you have suggestions.

106
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.700
Hart Montgomery: We would love to hear them.

107
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.560
Sally MacFarlane: Is there some way where we can see.

108
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.180
Sally MacFarlane: The things that it sort of scanning for at the moment is there, like a.

109
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.460
Sally MacFarlane: docs are pages.

110
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.110
Hart Montgomery: i'm not sure actually.

111
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.460
Hart Montgomery: I think it's changing a lot.

112
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.300
Hart Montgomery: So I don't know how well it's documented right now.

113
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:21.810
Sally MacFarlane: Right.

114
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.850
Hart Montgomery: I apologize for my lack of answers.

115
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.070
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, well, I guess, if anyone has questions on that.

116
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:42.060
Sally MacFarlane: We might get the metrics for the unless anyone specifically wants to.

117
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.490
Sally MacFarlane: Look at that.

118
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.420
Sally MacFarlane: OK, so the open forum.

119
00:17:52.890 --> 00:18:08.160
Sally MacFarlane: there's a there's been a proposal talked about for having an off week and discord voice chat made up say basically in between this contributor call have another call that sort of.

120
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.410
Sally MacFarlane: off the record.

121
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.200
Sally MacFarlane: Is their interest from this group to actually do that and it's time.

122
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:24.690
Frank Li: i'd be there yeah I saw the voice chat channel on the hyper ledger this quote.

123
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.930
Frank Li: And I thought you know that would be the perfect use case for that was kind of like Daddy.

124
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.370
Sally MacFarlane: yeah.

125
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.910
Sally MacFarlane: Sorry frank, would you be up for.

126
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.700
Sally MacFarlane: um making it happen.

127
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.050
Frank Li: yeah I can try to organize a time do we wanted to be for this time zones so.

128
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.260
Frank Li: around this time again or.

129
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.940
Sally MacFarlane: That there were me.

130
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.520
Frank Li: pose.

131
00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:03.060
Frank Li: Like a puzzle open question the the contributed channel so you're his his kinsmen.

132
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.470
Sally MacFarlane: Right.

133
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.810
Sally MacFarlane: um The next item is.

134
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.440
Sally MacFarlane: deprecating look for Jamie.

135
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.280
Sally MacFarlane: there's already a thread from i'm Diego and contribute a channel.

136
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.080
Sally MacFarlane: i'm not sure if that's been resolved or decided, yet I don't know if anyone here has.

137
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.480
Sally MacFarlane: Inside so.

138
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.680
Sally MacFarlane: I think the only the only snag was going to be.

139
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:51.210
Sally MacFarlane: Whether you could use an existing one for Jay xml config file.

140
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:52.650
Sally MacFarlane: With.

141

143
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:16.410
Sally MacFarlane: And the remaining thing on the list is about the looks good to me analysis.

144
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:26.580
Sally MacFarlane: Or is it hasn't been working for a while and there's been a couple of different reasons, what wasn't working, but right now it's.

145
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.650
Sally MacFarlane: Out of memory.

146
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.360
Sally MacFarlane: But i'm.

147
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:43.290
Sally MacFarlane: It sort of made me think well, is it actually worth getting it working again now that we have sign our cloud configured and running it's providing really rich output of you know code smells and central bugs and.

148
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:54.630
Sally MacFarlane: those sorts of things and I think, even if we got looks good to me what he again it's not really going to provide much extra on top of sign our cloud.

149
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.510
Sally MacFarlane: Does anyone have thoughts on that.

155
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:46.710
Sally MacFarlane: Okay anything anyone else wants to talk about is there anything we want to add to future topics.
