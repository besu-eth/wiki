1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.659
Jason Frame: today.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.980
Jason Frame: Okay, so start recording.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.990
Jason Frame: So this is the Antichrist policy do we need to just I just need to mention it.

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.700
Danno Ferrin: just mention it.

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:26.010
Jason Frame: Okay, so there's the antitrust policy if you want to read through that and they mean is recorded and place on the ship speaking, although in this movie and I don't think spending too much of an issue, so the first time we've got on here is the roadmap.

6
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.720
Jason Frame: So this my roadmap screen looks like it's been updated recently so there's a few more details in here.

7
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.810
Jason Frame: So in the 22.4 see that we've added some details about the improvements that are ongoing at the moment.

8
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.920
Jason Frame: did anyone want to speak to this, I think, selling you're on the call, we might be present to the top to what this is.

9
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.860
Sally MacFarlane: um yeah so ongoing efforts to.

10
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:10.110
Sally MacFarlane: improve the speed at which we find he is and also kind of managing the peer lists go forward so.

11
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.440
Sally MacFarlane: hearings quite a broad sort of topic so we're trying to.

12
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.260
Sally MacFarlane: sort of narrow down our investigation and effort into things that are actually going to make a difference, but we're still I guess in.

13
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:37.860
Sally MacFarlane: The discovery phase for a lot of it we haven't had any sort of specific wins just yet, but we're still working on it well, one thing that we are still waiting on a few people have been asking about is.

14
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.200
Sally MacFarlane: At the moment, you can end up with duplicate peers in your peers list and.

15
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.940
Sally MacFarlane: We are still still sort of checking down the root cause of that it's it's a bit more complicated than it.

16
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.000
Sally MacFarlane: Still.

17
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.340
Jason Frame: A descriptor the Mediterranean, I think, was here before, but I guess it's worth mentioning that the much focus of.

18
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:17.220
Jason Frame: This relation is to get ready get ready for the merge I know there's been multiple updates for all the different tests so.

19
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.170
Jason Frame: I don't really have much to add on that unless anyone else has got some details about what's happened there.

20
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.040
Jason Frame: Another was the ttp That was our first employee and they've asked them one release that went out.

21
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.690
Danno Ferrin: yeah I think the.

22
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.190
Danno Ferrin: contract is out for the beacon nope but I don't think it's going to merge till later this week.

23
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.830
Danno Ferrin: We get the details on that.

24
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.540
I.

25
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.130
Danno Ferrin: Just saw some chatter on Twitter today but it's not supposed to happen until that's just the beacon chain.

26
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.490
Danno Ferrin: And then, after this is gourley and then they're going to assess if me NUTS ready or not so it's it's insight.

27
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.920
Sally MacFarlane: that's good cool.

28
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.550
Jason Frame: with it.

29
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.420
Jason Frame: and the last thing.

30
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:24.990
Jason Frame: I want to throw all the rest of the stuff on people's faces light up at the out one more color on the 20th but for some improvements in their brand and the Russians.

31
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:39.570
Jason Frame: Another team i'm working on inside consensus can start looking at a distance in the near future, and this, the main candidate we've got in terms of proving say performances ethical because that's one thing.

32
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.040
Jason Frame: Obviously, as we get the if we use most.

33
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.130
Jason Frame: In production that we have.

34
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.540
Danno Ferrin: About get receipt.

35
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.990
Danno Ferrin: Like get transaction received by hash does that one high load.

36
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:10.140
Jason Frame: don't know actually need to look at that I just remember if call going cold out rather but we're right we're not looking to this so yeah to get transaction receipt that's a yeah I haven't looked at that see where that falls in that not sure.

37
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:19.050
Danno Ferrin: yeah it sounds like a call probably is on a publicly facing node will be a high high call one but as far as performance load testing.

38
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.680
Danno Ferrin: On the rpc note was actually the limiter on some of the speed tests that we had in our caliper tests and it was mostly.

39
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.650
Danno Ferrin: The transaction receipt and I blame part of the harness but we could also perform you know at a higher level, and you know the harnesses doing the wrong things.

40
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.370
Danno Ferrin: You know if the artist is doing the wrong things we should you know tune a little bit to it.

41
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.290
Danno Ferrin: because some of the the really crazy high numbers we've seen in the tests don't use that on there's like 1000.

42
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.870
Danno Ferrin: tps rating in one of the bugs reported, but they weren't getting individually receipts they're getting involved.

43
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.620
Danno Ferrin: But the caliper tests will get them individually, which reflects a more accurate high volume.

44
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:11.160
Danno Ferrin: Multi user system, but I think getting involved it's somewhere in between, but I think it's closer to everyone, getting their receipts via get received by hash so that's another one to keep an eye out for.

45
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.070
Jason Frame: yeah definitely um we we haven't.

46
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.750
Jason Frame: looked into this year with this down.

47
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:29.160
Jason Frame: put this on the roadmap to look at in the future, but yeah we'll have to determine which ones are not do recall ethical being one they, the more important ones, because this is one that can get very slow, depending on what call you're making it can vary a lot.

48
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:39.600
Jason Frame: But yeah that's good transaction receipts sounds like a good one to have as well put together list of what What if he stays to look at in terms of performance now.

49
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.960
Jason Frame: it's I think that it's probably it for the right map this out things further out less clear at the moment.

50
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.830
Jason Frame: I think these may have been here for a little more.

51
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.950
Jason Frame: Is anything else anyone wants to.

52
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.280
Jason Frame: Do we need to add to the roadmap or.

53
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.800
Jason Frame: Alright i've ever to.

54
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.530
Jason Frame: engender that.

55
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.720
Jason Frame: So.

56
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.080
Jason Frame: 24 points rate is gone out.

57
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.870
there.

58
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.520
Jason Frame: So this number of small improvements there and some fixes.

59
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.830
Jason Frame: yeah I think the coolest part is a great class you had for.

60
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.420
Jason Frame: dinner.

61
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.090
Jason Frame: And some bug there was a bug fixes to think that was the roll back of that obviously performance issue or I remember not sure that's in here.

62
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:50.730
Jason Frame: From the B roll back there, we had a problem with those a problem hearing remember correctly, that I think they got rolled back before it's really so this is not affected.

63
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.680
Jason Frame: Then, if there's anything else anyone with collections release it.

64
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.290
Jason Frame: it's like it's okay.

65
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.180
Jason Frame: alright.

66
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.060
Jason Frame: So next releases coming up pretty soon so you're taking that one dinner.

67
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.450
Danno Ferrin: yeah I was we'll talk about work updates as can take because the work update but.

68
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.260
Danno Ferrin: that's probably going to be put on hold we'll discuss it and I get to the details.

69
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:23.040
Jason Frame: Yes, you're right, I think, mentioned, I think we need some people to volunteer for the next coming releases.

70
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:34.050
Jason Frame: Is that we need to people who are for the July 13 20.7 RC tune with doing a one of and 20.7 releases.

71
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.030
Danno Ferrin: So one open question for Dr Caesar was just gonna be off of mainline.

72
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.480
Danno Ferrin: Are we going to maintain two lines and silver at 20 270.

73
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.780
Danno Ferrin: i'm okay with either, I just wanted to know before i'd cut the release what I need to set it up for.

74
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.000
Jason Frame: Anyone have anything so this was just this discussion, do you think we should.

75
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.160
Jason Frame: just go to bit more.

76
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.810
Danno Ferrin: Maybe a discussion on discord.

77
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:58.980
Jason Frame: yeah I think so.

78
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.960
Danno Ferrin: Unless there's customers that are needing and he's basically if we need to cut a.

79
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.980
Danno Ferrin: Do we want to cherry pick fixes in, or do we want to continue doing releases and my concern with.

80
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.340
Danno Ferrin: Making the RC.

81
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:25.080
Danno Ferrin: Separate is that accuse up like a month's worth of patches six weeks worth of patches into the dot one, which makes it just as big and just as dangerous, in my opinion, sir.

82
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.310
Jason Frame: it's a lot can happen in a few weeks yeah.

83
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:35.460
Jason Frame: sure that discussion in this code and it will be a lot easier to show.

84
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.470
Jason Frame: My branch well.

85
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:50.970
Jason Frame: let's let's go discussion so yeah work updates so see this point here about the Colonel that starting pretty soon.

86
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.500
Jason Frame: Does anyone know any more than this other than what's in the notes here and.

87
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.710
Danno Ferrin: um yeah that's something that I was able to get set up.

88
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.060
Jason Frame: Right.

89
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:05.790
Danno Ferrin: The big focus of the audit is going to be the execution engine so mostly, this is just a notice that an audit is going to be coming.

90
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:15.420
Danno Ferrin: And if you get audit related bugs fixed them quick and all your communications will be eventually made public, even though they would be private at the time, so keep that in mind, as you fix it.

91
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.450
Jason Frame: With the discussion going to happen for the order is that happening.

92
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.060
Danno Ferrin: And there's a channel.

93
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.790
Danno Ferrin: i'm on it they're supposed to be for status.

94
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.860
Danno Ferrin: And gary's on it.

95
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.790
Danno Ferrin: i'm remember who else I don't know if i'm.

96
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:34.590
If.

97
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.130
Danno Ferrin: Anyone elses on it that's that's a contract that's a contributor.

98
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:50.310
Danno Ferrin: We can put you on if you want to be on it's mostly going to be boring stuff and if we find you know items to be fixed will bring in the right people so.

99
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.090
Danno Ferrin: This is one of those the less you know, the better off it's going type things.

100
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.590
Jason Frame: Yes, yeah fair enough, I think that's progress, but then.

101
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.100
Jason Frame: In fact, this is mostly on the on the Internet.

102
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.480
Danno Ferrin: yeah okay.

103
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.510
Jason Frame: And there's a.

104
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.430
Jason Frame: he's got the exam i'm going to work update for the Java server migration.

105
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.660
Danno Ferrin: it's also me.

106
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.310
Jason Frame: that's what a great.

107
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:21.990
Jason Frame: What do you have.

108
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.930
Danno Ferrin: um I was going to return this weekend I started a couple weeks ago and going through today.

109
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:43.680
Danno Ferrin: i'm gonna put a status on a yellow and I think we should possibly consider moving into the 20 to 10 releases so that's 22 seven now as far as the code itself the code is fine, we could release it today, the issues comment in the build process and in the build tooling.

110
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:51.600
Danno Ferrin: To notable problems are LGBT and co Q amp l which, at the end of the day, are actually the same.

111
00:10:52.320 --> 00:11:09.630
Danno Ferrin: code coverage tool and they're just different packaging so probably want to keep code que El and get rid of LGBT because LDC i'm officially only supports up to Java 14 but kochi well as having issues with its analysis with some very standard Java 16 problems relating to.

112
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.730
Danno Ferrin: Where the you know add opens that extends and stuff like that.

113
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.690
Danno Ferrin: So I don't think code Q all is ready to move up to 17.

114
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.540
Danno Ferrin: So that's if we were to go to 17 we would need to drop one of our code quality tools at a minimum.

115
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:33.300
Danno Ferrin: Another quirk is that the docker images, the images and all those they no longer have a.

116
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:45.480
Danno Ferrin: jdk latest that we can use as easily see where we're handling it, and when we hand roll job at 18 and requires a version of ubuntu that is not signed yet on docker 24.

117
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.510
Danno Ferrin: So that to won't work, so we could get rid of jdk latest.

118
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:58.410
Danno Ferrin: But those two things together combined make me think the tooling isn't ready for Java 17 we shouldn't rely on it yet.

119
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:09.000
Danno Ferrin: So while base itself could compile and run there's a couple of code changes get past tests on that are entirely superficial, they just changed the text of an error, we try and detect um.

120
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:16.470
Danno Ferrin: But other than that you know the code compiles runs we just won't get access to the new features like records and some of the other.

121
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.230
Danno Ferrin: And multi line strings and switch expression statements which are really nice but ultimately not necessary.

122
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.570
Danno Ferrin: The remaining images the rating problems, I think, are just you know, we need to figure out how to make it work within docker.

123
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:33.210
Danno Ferrin: there's a test windows, we just need to make sure there's a windows image that has the right version of the jdk for the doctor.

124
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:40.590
Danno Ferrin: And then there is a couple of tests that rely on, and this is where i'm going to need help from the people who wrote this because I don't know quite what's going on.

125
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:52.320
Danno Ferrin: With the CLS work that was done for the pk I for qb FT and for some of these secure connections and assuming this is coming out of the EA stuff coming out of enterprise requirements.

126
00:12:52.980 --> 00:13:01.260
Danno Ferrin: Those don't work quite yet in the Java 17 docker images and i'm not entirely sure why and my concern is going into trying to fix it myself.

127
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:06.900
Danno Ferrin: Is I might just do fixes that might get rid of code algorithms that are there for a purpose.

128
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:13.350
Danno Ferrin: That not quite aware of so i'm losing some context, if I were to go in and fix it and say Oh, we don't need this code algorithm let's get rid of it.

129
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:21.090
Danno Ferrin: Since I didn't write it and wasn't aware of any things that needed to be and they weren't written into the PR that went in and there's no.

130
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:32.190
Danno Ferrin: Real traceability of why those went in what was important about them as far as particulars of the algorithms other than you know fits compliance and maybe that is all requirement is that they need to be the kids compliance once.

131
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:38.940
Danno Ferrin: But because of that i'm not comfortable going in and turning That apart, so there's unit tests that are breaking because.

132
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:58.560
Danno Ferrin: native libraries are not ready for Java 17 so that I think we might be able to get fixed in a week, but a coat ul and you go to images on the docker latest, the latest version, the jdk those to be indicate that we're we would probably be wise to hold it off three months.

133
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.300
Jason Frame: yeah.

134
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.020
Danno Ferrin: that's that's the.

135
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.040
Danno Ferrin: that's why I call it yellow.

136
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.270
Okay.

137
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:21.660
Jason Frame: yeah that sounds like a sensible idea and on the picture it bfa stuff and a little bit about there and I think there's probably plenty some help on that actually.

138
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.020
Jason Frame: Was that.

139
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:31.770
Danno Ferrin: So i'll keep the PR open PR creating all sorts of wonderful broken builds if you've been following circle ci today so.

140
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:39.570
Danno Ferrin: that the work i've done is out there, so it's stuff that can be built on and i'll go ahead and open up the branch that anyone that wants to commit to the can fix it but.

141
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.630
Danno Ferrin: I think for pretend we just need to keep the bridge open the whole time and try and get it to work he states we're ready in October.

142
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.380
Sally MacFarlane: I think that makes sense to to push it out to.

143
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.440
Jason Frame: reverse this.

144
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.410
Danno Ferrin: plus the merge will be done, and will only be doing one major change of the time so.

145
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.450
Danno Ferrin: Maybe there will be done not making an announcement.

146
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.030
Jason Frame: Work updates anyone wants to talk about.

147
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:23.730
Jason Frame: Okay.

148
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.310
Jason Frame: As far as I know.

149
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:33.090
Jason Frame: We haven't got this anything listed under other business is there anything else for the business.

150
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.270
Hart Montgomery: Do you mind if I jump in here.

151
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.440
Jason Frame: yeah place.

152
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.830
Hart Montgomery: Absolutely, so I know.

153
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:55.170
Hart Montgomery: Dan Oh, at least saw the the mail from TIM about the base who crp program so he would like everyone to document.

154
00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:11.490
Hart Montgomery: Their main net maintainer were there, there may network, basically, from the beginning of the year and I was wondering what you all thought was the best way to socialize this it looks like Diana and Sally have already done this, but no one else has.

155
00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:18.120
Sally MacFarlane: I think what you might have seen that has done Oh, and my name is on it was like a.

156
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:29.100
Sally MacFarlane: yeah first past and it's just put the link in a first pass at the possible format, so it might not be finalized.

157
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.150
Danno Ferrin: It may be finalized, but I put in my information so that's reflected.

158
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:33.900
Sally MacFarlane: done.

159
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.720
Hart Montgomery: Right so yeah I mean I don't think the format really matters that much as long as that yes, can.

160
00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.840
Hart Montgomery: You know, can find it.

161
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.990
Hart Montgomery: In in can efficiently decide.

162
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.340
Hart Montgomery: To whatever you really whatever you want to do is find there.

163
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.360
Hart Montgomery: TIM was just requesting it, that would be done in the not too distant future, so I was just wondering about.

164
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.390
Hart Montgomery: How we should best go about doing that.

165
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.420
Hart Montgomery: Should I just close this quarter something, please do this or.

166
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:14.220
Sally MacFarlane: I think I think do that and just trial this format.

167
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.130
Hart Montgomery: or yeah.

168
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:26.910
Hart Montgomery: Fine yeah oh Oh, I will mail TIM with this link and say like hey you know, does this format look okay.

169
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.300
Hart Montgomery: And if he says.

170
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.490
Hart Montgomery: Yes, then, then we can just go ahead and do it.

171
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.520
Hart Montgomery: Does that work for you all.

172
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:37.890
Sally MacFarlane: yeah.

173
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:47.460
Hart Montgomery: Yes, and I will say I had, I had a big long meeting with some lawyers last week and we appear to be in good shape from that left side.

174
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.290
Hart Montgomery: So we should be able to move forward there.

175
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:56.070
Danno Ferrin: will be.

176
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.940
Hart Montgomery: So yeah thanks and sorry to interrupt the meeting.

177
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.810
Jason Frame: I know that's that's great i'll put that in aqua says.

178
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.400
Jason Frame: Something girl the details, but i'm the same for now.

179
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.460
Sally MacFarlane: Can I ask a question on the.

180
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:27.840
Sally MacFarlane: time frame.

181
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.410
Sally MacFarlane: Like is it hey to answer the first person.

182
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.190
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's genuinely one through now.

183
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.200
Sally MacFarlane: Right, so that should be hey john 2020 that page.

184
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.270
Hart Montgomery: yeah that's right.

185
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.170
Hart Montgomery: So, but you just made a typo it's not the end of the world.

186
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.330
Jason Frame: So you you, you say you're going to have that discussion on this code and TIM and.

187
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:12.090
Hart Montgomery: yeah so i'll just mail TIM, to make sure he's okay with format and then assuming he is you know we'll just ask everybody to document, their main network in a similar format.

188
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.020
Jason Frame: Oh.

189
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.830
Danno Ferrin: cool i'm sorry to drop off, but I needed to go pick up my son from the airport so.

190
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.330
Danno Ferrin: don't think there's anything.

191
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.770
Danno Ferrin: else on the agenda that needs my contribution requires it.

192
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.200
Jason Frame: Thanks to.

193
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.640
Sally MacFarlane: A Santa.

194
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:48.870
Jason Frame: Do we will go through the metro for you and I think last time we scripted the may not be much that goes through their new Does anyone want to get through this door.

195
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.470
Jason Frame: I think they'll take a skiff.

196
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.720
Jason Frame: Okay, to skip and what else we got here, this is a this is interesting proposal that.

197
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.200
Jason Frame: let's go to let me know that's waiting.

198
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.880
Jason Frame: Nicholas started, we might not.

199
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.810
Jason Frame: I think I think you can do this part right here, I think i'll have the discussion on this tour, to see what people really.

200
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.740
Jason Frame: want to do here, but.

201
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:26.040
Jason Frame: yeah they shall I think we have anyone to actually talk to this too much.

202
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:39.120
Jason Frame: But there's a proposal be at that nicholas's may to move some of the make it easier to find quite find answers to questions and make a bit more organized.

203
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:51.630
Jason Frame: So I guess if people can go through here at their comments, Dr Melanie just share this a bit more on i'm not sure if this was shared on what's going on but article.

204
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:53.490
Sally MacFarlane: It was.

205
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.110
Jason Frame: It was great.

206
00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.820
Jason Frame: Okay, so what's paper.

207
00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.490
Jason Frame: few more comments here.

208
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.990
Jason Frame: Let me do this in this meeting on this tomorrow, until we get it.

209
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:10.590
Jason Frame: ever.

210
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.780
Jason Frame: smoked a day on this.

211
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.630
Jason Frame: list does anyone want to talk to this at all.

212
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.550
Sally MacFarlane: Good to get.

213
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.270
Sally MacFarlane: people's thoughts on this like there.

214
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.720
Sally MacFarlane: Are some things in disco that are really annoying like threaded discussions and it's really hard to search.

215
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.970
Sally MacFarlane: For things.

216
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:51.540
Sally MacFarlane: So this proposal is basically to enable github discussion so that we can build up that kind of knowledge base on the github discussion side of things, but it comes with the drawback of then having to so those repositories are two things to keep track of.

217
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.090
Constantly.

218
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.670
Sally MacFarlane: So yeah it would just be interesting to you.

219
00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:58.590
Jason Frame: yeah.

220
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.050
Jason Frame: So.

221
00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:03.480
Jason Frame: I think we'll just have to.

222
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.430
Jason Frame: wait for people to engage in this, because this looks at some feedback here.

223
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.500
Jason Frame: A strong, yes, well, not the moment I think both incoming with pros and cons, unfortunately, like I said.

224
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.430
Sally MacFarlane: yeah I don't think there's any moving away from.

225
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:34.440
Sally MacFarlane: discord I think described as the point that i'm trying to keep it is it's just whether it makes sense to utilize github discussions alongside.

226
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.230
Jason Frame: Here, I think it could be interesting to try and I want you to have discussions and see if it does help.

227
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.730
Jason Frame: And people might just start using that as well.

228
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:53.400
Sally MacFarlane: yeah, so I think it has to be more than just enabling it because we enabled it before and knowing, you said that we disabled it.

229
00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:01.470
Sally MacFarlane: So I think it's going to be more than just turning it on it's going to be, you know I think Helens last comment that was about.

230
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:12.450
Sally MacFarlane: says maintain is building up that knowledge base, you know, we find that we're answering the same question repeatedly you know, and maybe that's a candidate to add to that kind of knowledge base.

231
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.650
Jason Frame: Important so we can probably start triggering the knowledge base they're important people towards them.

232
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.890
Jason Frame: In ways from questions and more help.

233
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.230
Jason Frame: alright.

234
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:38.610
Jason Frame: later there with that one for now it's just as far as what of what the next step on this is to sneak more.

235
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.960
Jason Frame: Some more feedback on this before.

236
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.170
Sally MacFarlane: yeah Maybe someone can possibly be guided to.

237
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.530
Sally MacFarlane: just remind people to comment.

238
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.590
Jason Frame: Good that's a good idea.

239
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.380
Jason Frame: that's everything on the agenda was there anything else that anyone wants to come up.

240
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.880
Jason Frame: Well, stop the share that.

241
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.180
Jason Frame: And that's it for tonight and.

242
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:18.480
Jason Frame: If ever.

243
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:19.800
kids.

244
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.500
Hart Montgomery: Right, thank you.
