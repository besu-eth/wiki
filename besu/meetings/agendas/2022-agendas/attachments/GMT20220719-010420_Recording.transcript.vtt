00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.270
Danno Ferrin: This is going to the cloud I don't know if it's gonna be my computer after this or not so.

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.660
Sally MacFarlane: cloud sounds good.

3
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.310
Sally MacFarlane: um okay so starting off with the housekeeping the antitrust tinnitus.

4
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.160
Sally MacFarlane: which, hopefully, everyone should be aware of if you're not.

5
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.570
Sally MacFarlane: You can go and read it, but.

6
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.810
Sally MacFarlane: it's fairly sensible.

7
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:41.070
Sally MacFarlane: This means being recorded me speaking, and I will try and keep an eye on the right hand if you have a question or something to say.

8
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.220
Sally MacFarlane: I don't have anything on the general announcements Does anyone want to jump in with anything.

9
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.320
Danno Ferrin: No.

10
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.920
No.

11
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.780
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, so the.

12
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.700
Sally MacFarlane: roadmap.

13
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.280
Sally MacFarlane: I haven't actually took this recently.

14
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.770
Sally MacFarlane: So we have got 24 there 27.

15
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.320
Sally MacFarlane: So that's imagine price match cleanup.

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.180
Sally MacFarlane: And then.

17
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.500
Sally MacFarlane: we'd like to look at modulation.

18
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.350
Sally MacFarlane: See oh yeah.

19
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.060
Sally MacFarlane: i'm release date so 20 270 RC one was completed a weekend a bit ago.

20
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.620
Sally MacFarlane: See to his children for the 20th which is like.

21
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.190
Sally MacFarlane: The day after tomorrow, no time.

22
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.330
Danno Ferrin: yeah it's a it's Monday here so it'll be Wednesday here when I actually do it.

23
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:51.780
Sally MacFarlane: And I think there was some conversation in the basic release channel about particular PR that we're tracking it to so I guess.

24
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.560
Danno Ferrin: yeah either get closer attention to that.

25
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.120
Danno Ferrin: makes you before I build it.

26
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.570
Sally MacFarlane: yeah yeah cool sounds like it's under control.

27
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:17.190
Sally MacFarlane: and work updates I just put in some things here about what my team is working on with peering improvement so we're kind of at the stage where we're testing out a few hypotheses and seeing how they perform in a different test, so I just like to eat needs there.

28
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.770
Sally MacFarlane: Nothing set in stone, yet.

29
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.410
Sally MacFarlane: Since.

30
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:39.780
Danno Ferrin: I think the last year to work on that was married before she went over to the tech team, so a lot of the stuff in the network code um is all in not many people who know what decisions were made, I mean some of it dates back to Pantheon be honest like pre release Pantheon.

31
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.270
Danno Ferrin: yeah so if something doesn't make sense, you want to just rip it out and replace it, I don't think you'll get much pushback.

32
00:02:46.770 --> 00:03:03.090
Sally MacFarlane: yeah so um yeah Luckily, we have actually been able to get in touch with meredith and she has given us some input, so we are looking at making some changes there but it's good to get sort of remembrance of the history of you know why certain decisions are made and stuff so.

33
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.200
Sally MacFarlane: So that's been quite useful yeah.

34
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.380
Danno Ferrin: Its role in our team that are going to be the hard ones to get Ahold of.

35
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.370
Sally MacFarlane: Getting back a bit further Okay, and so the next.

36
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.110
Danno Ferrin: coach that'll.

37
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.250
Danno Ferrin: I mean, in some ways to look at and say that's been that sticky ball is good, but on the other hand, it's smileys becoming the weak spot.

38
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.330
Sally MacFarlane: yeah yeah exactly, and so the next item here is looking at this, the five support so.

39
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:41.100
Sally MacFarlane: Basically, basically doesn't support this be five at the moment, we want to add that in because we think it will make peering in general faster.

40
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.280
Sally MacFarlane: So we want to start some investigation on how we would actually do that, like what.

41
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.390
Sally MacFarlane: How we would plan and sort of design that.

42
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.080
Sally MacFarlane: And one scientist by V1.

43
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.500
Sally MacFarlane: And as far as I can tell basically doesn't support this wi fi at all right now.

44
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.080
Danno Ferrin: That matches my recollection.

45
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.380
Danno Ferrin: Do you see with discovery five is there wasn't.

46
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.320
Danno Ferrin: It was like it gets research project and never got standardized.

47
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:25.290
Sally MacFarlane: Right, so it seems like the situation with gift right now is before still the default, but they have a cla option we can turn on be five as well.

48
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.700
Danno Ferrin: Rather standards are we just working against guess on this.

49
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.400
Sally MacFarlane: That is a good question.

50
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.590
Sally MacFarlane: I can I see what i'm saying right so.

51
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.840
Sally MacFarlane: i've got one is only one.

52
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:51.600
Antoine Toulme: might as well, throw yeah there's a standard, you can go to the github COM slash you feel you themselves def p2p and it's got all the different actionable messages.

53
00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:06.930
Antoine Toulme: there's a handshake with this be five and easy for you just you just blasting everybody and trying to get on piers and this the five you're supposed to use a handshake to kind of facilitate your traffic's it cannot be.

54
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:17.460
Antoine Toulme: apparent that you're doing a discovery call over UDP, and so it would allow you to have better censorship resistance, if you were to do that.

55
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:35.010
Antoine Toulme: And that's was headed by the lighthouse folks from looking at the five which apparently was a little too open ended and have a vector of attacks so, unfortunately, that complicates the code quite a bit it's just a little bit more.

56
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.230
Sally MacFarlane: yeah.

57
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.160
Antoine Toulme: Certain trades.

58
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.470
Antoine Toulme: yep then.

59
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:55.200
Sally MacFarlane: So we have, there is a consensus maintained disk be five repository So hopefully that hide some of the complexity there, but I would have to check if that's five dot one.

60
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.190
Sally MacFarlane: Ticket already uses.

61
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.340
Antoine Toulme: yeah, it has to be first one if it's just political.

62
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.630
Sally MacFarlane: Right yeah.

63
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.370
Antoine Toulme: it's using nettie.

64
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.850
Antoine Toulme: Sorry.

65
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.200
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, thanks.

66
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.710
Sally MacFarlane: So yeah we would be looking at using that discovery repo that's already there so hopefully a lot of the.

67
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.120
Sally MacFarlane: code is already written and we can just.

68
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.260
Sally MacFarlane: sort of plug it in.

69
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.240
Sally MacFarlane: But that's the investigation that was those starting this week.

70
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.010
Sally MacFarlane: Any other comments on on.

71
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:47.820
Sally MacFarlane: Thanks everyone for that extra context and then it's helpful and so the next item here is one that jason's team is working on, so the so called performance improvements, did you want to talk to that one Jason.

72
00:06:49.620 --> 00:07:02.340
Jason Frame: Oh yeah I can talk a little bit so like I said look I just started this So the idea is to look at the current performance of ethical compare that against some clients per starship best line and look at different types of.

73
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:10.410
Jason Frame: Contracts because a very act is called what we've been we've been told us this quarter variation depending on what kind of.

74
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.470
Jason Frame: If call you're doing look at those and the idea is to start with the very basic kind of as I, as a 20.

75
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:32.610
Jason Frame: bounce call and have a have a look at that and then have a look at other cases there but we're really yeah we're right at the start of this so we don't know exactly.

76
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.660
Jason Frame: What potion tech at the moment i've been thinking that based on.

77
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.150
Sally MacFarlane: Any other updates.

78
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:55.290
Danno Ferrin: Probably the one I mentioned before the call I took a look at the graph que El specs and the theory of execution api's um.

79
00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:03.540
Danno Ferrin: let's look at this, because this is dovetailing some stuff working on doing the data with our json rpc bridge, but I saw they have a graph que El spec in it.

80
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:10.500
Danno Ferrin: it's kind of annoyed that they moved it from the IP into the execution api's without much fanfare and apparently that's going to be the standard spec going forward.

81
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:17.940
Danno Ferrin: Some of the issues are that they don't have a graph que El schema output, they just have the graph que El de js intermediate form in there.

82
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:28.350
Danno Ferrin: So i've got a patch pending to get that fixed in but after that what they've done as a base it off of gets version which is mostly the same there's some minor differences but there's some significant.

83
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.750
Danno Ferrin: Standard ads and a couple of quality life that's that I think are good and we needed support for the.

84
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:43.740
Danno Ferrin: Pricing limits the the free market stuff so that went in, and I think that's a good ad and also the access list in.

85
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:50.970
Danno Ferrin: 2930 VIP 2930 for type one and Type two transactions and those I think are absolutely necessary spec ads.

86
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:59.340
Danno Ferrin: The one quality of life that that I like is he also had in getting the raw transaction and block in block header.

87
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:07.770
Danno Ferrin: And receipts our lps is an option to get from that but there's a couple of other changes they put in there, the meats and stuff not knowable and eligible just arbitrarily.

88
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:17.820
Danno Ferrin: And they added a effective tip which no other rpc is us, so I didn't put those in initially i'm gonna have another round of PR is once my PR to.

89
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:26.430
Danno Ferrin: Get the graph to schema into the execution APIs gets accepted emerged and then we'll have another discussion about which get ads are worth keeping in which ones.

90
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.050
Danno Ferrin: should be reverted to the VIP level and which one should be have an open discussion in the interim.

91
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:37.920
Danno Ferrin: So, but the PR this other view it's not urgent it's mostly it is just a lot so.

92
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:48.900
Danno Ferrin: Rather than you know, being a good boy working on my day job I said this is going to be fixed and i'm going to do it now, because I don't want to work before I go on vacation on stuff that I can't drop in this is sort of the backdrop and.

93
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.690
Danno Ferrin: So this PR is me finally finishing off.

94
00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:00.600
Sally MacFarlane: Okay awesome thanks Dan I I don't have the link the PR number but i'll add that, after.

95
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.420
Danno Ferrin: yeah Oh, let me find it not drop it in chat.

96
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.950
Sally MacFarlane: Okay cool.

97
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:13.110
Sally MacFarlane: um any other worth updates or anton's back now did you have anything else you wanted to add for the discovery be faster.

98
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.320
Antoine Toulme: No, no it's all good sorry about that.

99
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.620
Sally MacFarlane: yeah that's fine, thank you for that extra context.

100
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.540
Danno Ferrin: useful.

101
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:30.360
Sally MacFarlane: OK so moving on to other business there's a PR around at a may get.

102
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.370
Sally MacFarlane: I don't know how to say that i've only ever seen it in.

103
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.270
Danno Ferrin: Attendance protocol.

104
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.980
Sally MacFarlane: There entities yeah.

105
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.530
Sally MacFarlane: yeah but how do you say the plp.

106
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.780
Danno Ferrin: Somehow.

107
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.910
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, so I guess, we can have a discussion if people have.

108
00:10:53.940 --> 00:11:00.300
Sally MacFarlane: Strong opinions now, or we can have that discussion I think about whether we should add that badge and he read me.

109
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.890
Antoine Toulme: The don't have any value right.

110
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.040
Antoine Toulme: there's no monetary value associated with them.

111
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.140
Sally MacFarlane: I don't think so.

112
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.150
Danno Ferrin: I think they're sold out.

113
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.840
Danno Ferrin: There good example of a utility and FT.

114
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.000
Antoine Toulme: Okay.

115
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.740
Danno Ferrin: I mean you can claim them, whether or not we put it in the.

116
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.920
Danno Ferrin: middle we put it in a readme people can claim it.

117
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:39.180
Antoine Toulme: i'll get you and so that's not the who initiated this with it by based routing intuitive someone from gets put up asking.

118
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.070
Sally MacFarlane: This person which i'm guessing is from good pop.

119
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.110
Antoine Toulme: No okay.

120
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.350
Antoine Toulme: Okay.

121
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.500
Antoine Toulme: yeah no problem is this.

122
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.680
Danno Ferrin: Little think it matters too much.

123
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.370
Danno Ferrin: I mean it's It shows membership and the greater Community the last part.

124
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:21.600
Antoine Toulme: Just about this native should be added to the other repository maybe basic docs as just.

125
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.110
Sally MacFarlane: As we should yeah I think that's a legit.

126
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:28.710
Danno Ferrin: let's do it.

127
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:36.030
Antoine Toulme: If anything i'd rather have poor Apps for bigfoot damage than good about that.

128
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.290
Sally MacFarlane: Why do you say that.

129
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.380
Antoine Toulme: Because I think you might not want to have.

130
00:12:50.640 --> 00:13:04.980
Antoine Toulme: People chasing fame and fortune going to you and saying hey I found a typo in one of your inner classes, that you know the spells method name that's private that nobody cares about so they can claim it pull up.

131
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:21.030
Antoine Toulme: Whereas if someone makes a documentation update I think that's very valuable all the time, so it's just it's just an opinion, I think it's it's great to have it just seeing that visit docs I think even make sense to have it.

132
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.000
So.

133
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.570
Sally MacFarlane: Any other thoughts.

134
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.890
Jason Frame: Is a encouraged contributors.

135
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:59.670
Danno Ferrin: retro retrospective it's retroactive so we don't encourage contributors specifically to base soup but stuff like this and encourage people to contribute to larger theory and project so.

136
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:07.350
Danno Ferrin: I think I see the value in this is more than just basically we're just a participant in the greater the system there's getting these these poets.

137
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:08.730
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.230
Sally MacFarlane: i'm hot you had your hand up but you've taken it back down, did you want to add something.

139
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:19.260
Hart Montgomery: For sure I was just gonna say that people have usually found that badging systems can have.

140
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.760
Hart Montgomery: positive impacts on contributions.

141
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.970
Hart Montgomery: So I think adding it to a documentation is a great idea.

142
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.840
Hart Montgomery: it's one of the hardest things to get people to contribute to.

143
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.430
Sally MacFarlane: The point.

144
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.020
Sally MacFarlane: metrics review unless anyone really wants to look at graphs right now.

Sally MacFarlane: open for future topics Does anyone want to add.
