Sally MacFarlane: Hello!

2
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.320
Gabriel Trintinalia: Hello!

3
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.179
Jason Frame: Eight

4
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.660
Sally MacFarlane: Last Chance to add anything to the agenda. I

5
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.029
should. I start?

6
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.330
Sally MacFarlane: Uh, i'm gonna wait one more minute.

7
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.980
Sally MacFarlane: It's pretty fast.

8
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.360
Simon Dudley: Hello!

9
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.129
Sally MacFarlane: One minutes a really long time. And

10
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.500
okay,

11
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.800
Sally MacFarlane: okay,

12
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.409
Sally MacFarlane: uh, say, housekeeping. We've got the antitrust notice which uh

13
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.920
one should read

14
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.629
Sally MacFarlane: already. These being recorded,

15
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.930
Let's stay on meet them, mostly speaking

16
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.300
Sally MacFarlane: an input.

17
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.969
Sally MacFarlane: Uh, I will try and keep an eye on the right hand thing. But if I don't see it,

18
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.240
Sally MacFarlane: and

19
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:19.269
Sally MacFarlane: so I didn't have any general announcements for the on the agenda. Does anyone have anything in general? I'd like to,

20
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.950
Sally MacFarlane: announced,

21
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.270
Sally MacFarlane: No

22
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.970
Sally MacFarlane: uh. So the Roadmap Review.

23
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.600
Sally MacFarlane: Uh,

24
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.119
Sally MacFarlane: i'm not sure if this has been updated recently. But I did

25
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.229
Sally MacFarlane: um put a link in there to the public, Then hub board.

26
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.840
Sally MacFarlane: Um,

27
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.520
Sally MacFarlane: yeah, so it does look like the the roadmap in the Wiki has been updated, but also

28
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.619
Sally MacFarlane: um. This public then have board, I think once we sort of have that set up and established. It should

29
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:06.230
Sally MacFarlane: probably be a more accurate reflection of what's actually in progress. Um, and what's upcoming because it's based off. Um,

30
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.390
Sally MacFarlane: you know, Github issues and ethics that we actually use

31
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.180
Sally MacFarlane: when doing that work?

32
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.540
Sally MacFarlane: Um:

33
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.919
Sally MacFarlane: So yeah, feedback feedback on that

34
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.010
Sally MacFarlane: good Um,

35
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.860
Sally MacFarlane: i'm thinking of you, den, if that's of interest to you. Um!

36
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.319
Sally MacFarlane: He got a

37
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.600
Sally MacFarlane: um release updates so twenty, two, ten, zero,

38
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.729
Sally MacFarlane: which means that twenty, two, ten, one should be coming up in about a week. I think, Jason, you're on the

39
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.590
Sally MacFarlane: our next one,

40
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.700
Jason Frame: that I am

41
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.090
Sally MacFarlane: awesome.

42
00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:00.990
Sally MacFarlane: Um, i'm not sure. Is Is there anything specific about that release, or is it just sort of um general work in progress, and

43
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.449
Sally MacFarlane: anything you want to say about that, Jason,

44
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.310
Jason Frame: I don't know. I thought it was just

45
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.170
Sally MacFarlane: um cool, awesome.

46
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.590
Sally MacFarlane: So I've also put a link here to

47
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.660
Sally MacFarlane: a

48
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.140
Sally MacFarlane: It is public, even though

49
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.410
Sally MacFarlane: it's not public.

50
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.219
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, I will

51
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.570
Sally MacFarlane: figure that out.

52
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.960
Sally MacFarlane: Um.

53
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.610
Sally MacFarlane: Oh, oh, i'll figure that out and get back to you. But basically

54
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.040
Sally MacFarlane: um!

55
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.540
Sally MacFarlane: The idea is to cause the relationship around the marriage. Um! There was some

56
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.280
Sally MacFarlane: uh

57
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:58.400
Sally MacFarlane: conflict frustrations. Um! So we just wanted to put the effort in. Now that sort of the merger died down, and um the the

58
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:14.470
Sally MacFarlane: the pressures off a little bit to just sort of um address the issues with our release process that made that a bit frustrating. So I will get. I'll make sure that this document is made public. However, that works um, and we'll get get your report on that demo

59
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.639
Sally MacFarlane: uh you can see where sort of. There's a lot of conversations still happening even with amongst us, about

60
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.079
Sally MacFarlane: how that should work.

61
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.350
Um anything. Do you want to say anything about that

62
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:32.899
Sally MacFarlane: now? All right. This is the first time seeing the documents, so I shouldn't comment on it. Okay,

63
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.139
Sally MacFarlane: I will. I'll get back to you one

64
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.860
Sally MacFarlane: uh so work updates.

65
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.750
Sally MacFarlane: We Um, we've got Shanghai coming up

66
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.300
Sally MacFarlane: uh,

67
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.770
Sally MacFarlane: so

68
00:07:53.790 --> 00:08:07.119
Sally MacFarlane: I just um put this in a wiki this morning as well. So this is um a short list of what we think is likely to go in Shanghai, and then I think this is a bit of a long list here of things that

69
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.960
Sally MacFarlane: um

70
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.040
Sally MacFarlane: a a further out.

71
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.039
Sally MacFarlane: Uh, I know, Dana, you've done some work already on the Eos.

72
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.180
Sally MacFarlane: Um paces.

73
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.970
Sally MacFarlane: We Yeah,

74
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.100
Danno Ferrin: the is getting kind of an interesting push. Um.

75
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:37.839
Danno Ferrin: There is a notion of something called largeiof and small Leo F. And what is already approved, for Shanghai is considered smallly. O, it's just the object format and code validation.

76
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:45.930
Danno Ferrin: Um! But what a lot of the Evm contributors are trying to get pushed is! Add a couple of other features. Um

77
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.760
Danno Ferrin: and um!

78
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.620
Danno Ferrin: There's one other feature

79
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.580
Danno Ferrin: relative jumps,

80
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.039
Danno Ferrin: and if they get those two features in that solves a lot of

81
00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:03.819
Danno Ferrin: what a lot of people like Greg Cole that have been pushing for to get something that can be compiled natively in linear time to to a native machine code,

82
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:14.669
Danno Ferrin: so that reduces a lot of the risk of of compiler bombs coming in. The problem, is It's it? Some people think it's too big. If if Shanghai is going to ship in Q. One. Q. Two,

83
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:25.530
Danno Ferrin: um. So i'm working with that group. I'm going to take the lead over the next few weeks to try and you finish off and ship eo f small into

84
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:37.710
Danno Ferrin: um. They su and and get as far as I can on the Uf. Large. It doesn't look that difficult the issue there is going to be the testing burden, and some of the other features coming in around it to see if those can get limited or not.

85
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.900
Danno Ferrin: Um,

86
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:58.490
Danno Ferrin: so I think. Uh, There's also another test net that sprung up That's gotten the Etherium Foundation sanction called the Shame don Test net, and that is basically the Shanghai changes um plus most of these. You have large changes on top of it, and depending upon how all court devs goes on Thursday, including all the other little litty bitty

87
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.450
Danno Ferrin: um

88
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:08.409
Danno Ferrin: stuff that's coming in. So basically anything that's a execution environment related is being pushed into Shang dong to see if we can get it

89
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.599
Danno Ferrin: functional and testing um before the the interop event plan and early January.

90
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:22.029
Danno Ferrin: It's there's no there's only one G shan dong um. I've made that mistake by

91
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:40.490
Danno Ferrin: um, and that's we're run by the ethereum Js group. So they're still on that test net. I mean that the tune Id is going to be a moving target. I'm. Already put in the Pr. To add that as a name test net in base. But some of things moving around on that. So that's what i'm working off of. And

92
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:53.030
Danno Ferrin: what I like about the Shan dong test net is, I've been kind of, you know, stalled on. How do I activate the Shanghai changes because coming out of Dev Con. There have been some discussions. Do we activate Shanghai in a timestamp or at a block number

93
00:10:53.260 --> 00:11:04.869
Danno Ferrin: Um and timestamp looks like It's winning. Um. So that's probably something we should put on the board. Um is is activating the for it to be a timestamp, and while we're refactoring it. Maybe we do the total difficulty.

94
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:23.430
Danno Ferrin: Um, But those are some changes that are deep being discussed for activating Shanghai. And then, of course, the uh the big items that people want for Shanghai deposits is is the driver for Shanghai, wherever deposits is of deposits needs more time. Shanghai is gonna move out to accommodate it, the the uh

95
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:31.779
Danno Ferrin: back to the not to pause the um validator withdrawals. That is what's driving the Shane high release, and what will dominate the schedule.

96
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:44.140
Danno Ferrin: So that's That's one thing to keep in mind. Um forty, eight, forty-four is a target of opportunity for Shanghai. But a lot of people are skeptical, and i'm thinking it's going to be in Canc, which will probably be in the latter half

97
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.849
Danno Ferrin: of um

98
00:11:46.020 --> 00:12:03.569
Danno Ferrin: of two thousand and twenty-three. It's it's very, very important to layer two protocols to get forty, eight, forty-four in as soon as possible. So there's going to be a lot of movement, a lot of pressure and a lot of activity on that, just to give a forecast on it. But if if I had to make it more likely to not call.

99
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:18.329
Danno Ferrin: I would say it's gonna mission high and make cancun and drive cancun in the second half of the year. But I don't have much confidence on that there's a lot of other things that could make Shanghai and Shanghai could be late. Um it won't come before deposits.

100
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:24.980
Danno Ferrin: It might come in two thousand and twenty-four it's it's hard to tell with that. So that's um, that's the question

101
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.839
Danno Ferrin: allcore, devs and the eo f break out last week

102
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.940
Sally MacFarlane: was there a night that came out of that.

103
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.799
Danno Ferrin: Yeah, it's in the discord. Um, let me find

104
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:50.960
Danno Ferrin: it's. Uh there was. It was in the All Court des Channel. Let me go ahead and paste that in.

105
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.260
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, that'd be good

106
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.590
Danno Ferrin: um

107
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.840
Danno Ferrin: copy

108
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:02.919
Danno Ferrin: message link.

109
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.220
Danno Ferrin: Come back into

110
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.330
Danno Ferrin: discord.

111
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.829
Danno Ferrin: No, that's not what I wanted

112
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.070
Danno Ferrin: necessary to. Actually,

113
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.760
Danno Ferrin: it's going to take you through discord. So let me.

114
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.850
Danno Ferrin: Here's a better link.

115
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.500
There we go,

116
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.340
Sally MacFarlane: awesome.

117
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:39.650
Danno Ferrin: So what's in and out of Shanghai has not been decided what's in in that account has not been decided.

118
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.649
Danno Ferrin: Hopefully, we'll have clarity before the first of December,

119
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:55.770
Danno Ferrin: and I think, as far as between those two, the shot. This stuff in Shandong is going to go in one of Shanghai or Cancun, and if it's done enough

120
00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:00.970
Danno Ferrin: um by December they're going to optimistically target. But Shanghai and that's what I'm pushing for.

121
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:02.950
Sally MacFarlane: Mhm.

122
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.340
Sally MacFarlane: Okay.

123
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.079
Sally MacFarlane: So then,

124
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.590
Sally MacFarlane: this this

125
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:20.579
Sally MacFarlane: sort of these lists could still change these absolutely. Yeah,

126
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:29.040
Danno Ferrin: Eo F is big. I'm doing that warm home base. I have code written for that already. Push zero. I have code written ready to go

127
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.680
Danno Ferrin: um.

128
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.340
Danno Ferrin: It's It's in a different. Pr. It's, it's it's combined with my eo F one.

129
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.719
Danno Ferrin: I have not done

130
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.039
Sally MacFarlane: the hang on

131
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:49.439
Danno Ferrin: warm Coin base. That's that's been reviewed, and it's about to merge. I was gonna let it sit for twenty-four hours before I emerged. It

132
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.890
Danno Ferrin: Push zero is easy. It's it's locked in with my E of change. I could split it out if needed.

133
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.510
Danno Ferrin: Um

134
00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:04.230
Danno Ferrin: code validation thirty, six, seventy that's in my eo F uh prototype

135
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.710
Danno Ferrin: um,

136
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.550
Danno Ferrin: and I haven't touched limit and meter in it, Code. So i'll.

137
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.180
Danno Ferrin: That's gonna be my lowest priority.

138
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:25.340
Danno Ferrin: That's another one that touches the execution realm. Um! But I think you's going to keep me occupied with small and large. Ef so,

139
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.779
Danno Ferrin: if that's neat, that's um

140
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:35.999
Danno Ferrin: that's going to make Shanghai. So if if people want to pick that up before December, If not, i'll come and get it near the other December.

141
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:44.760
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, all right. Well, we um, I think. Justin's got his name on it. So yeah,

142
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.520
Sally MacFarlane: Haven't seen that i'll stay away from it.

143
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.410
Sally MacFarlane: We just yeah, we just um

144
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.890
Sally MacFarlane: didn't. We don't want to do rework. I guess we we just want to make sure that Um:

145
00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.079
Sally MacFarlane: yeah, I think I posted several times the branch I'm working on

146
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.540
Sally MacFarlane: that. Yeah, with one.

147
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.709
Danno Ferrin: Yeah, my Eos branch. Yeah, there we go. That one.

148
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.110
Sally MacFarlane: So these two are in that one.

149
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.210
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, yeah, okay.

150
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.820
Danno Ferrin: And I've got it packed up. So I took all of the uh reference tests,

151
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.920
Danno Ferrin: and I merge those together. Um,

152
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:25.910
Danno Ferrin: i'm questionable about some of the quality of some of the block reference tests. I don't think they're quite right yet. Why, they haven't been merged.

153
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.739
Danno Ferrin: But the the general State test I got working for push zero.

154
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:36.529
Danno Ferrin: And now i'm going to be working on the eolf ones and figuring out what's broken and what's not, I haven't even activated it yet. So

155
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.830
Danno Ferrin: so that's what's coming on. Once Once I get those reference tests

156
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.899
Danno Ferrin: working. I'll look into checking in some of that, but it's not going to make

157
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.259
Danno Ferrin: twenty-two ten one. It might make twenty-two ten to

158
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.710
Danno Ferrin: Well, there's reference tests with the eo f stuff, and this zero has reference tests.

159
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.010
Danno Ferrin: So that was

160
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:08.120
Danno Ferrin: um. So I have reference tests. Reference tests are going to be my standard, for when I check in

161
00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:22.340
Danno Ferrin: when I can go green on the uh general State reference test on what's checked in and the Prs. These aren't merged yet into like the full reference test developed branch. They're speculatively put in, and i'm sure they'll move around and change it. Get fixed. So

162
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:40.250
Danno Ferrin: okay. So there's reference tests that are being developed, and you're doing it.

163
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.010
Danno Ferrin: Which Um,

164
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.389
Danno Ferrin: i'm fairly certain is mandated to be zero.

165
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.010
Danno Ferrin: So

166
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.080
Danno Ferrin: i'm not passing those, but it passes the general state variance.

167
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.450
So

168
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.370
Sally MacFarlane: Okay,

169
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.559
Sally MacFarlane: cool. Well, um, obviously, if there's uh other,

170
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:14.210
Danno Ferrin: you know. Um Eps that need to be added or um things. This this page can be updated. So Yeah, there's a couple of other E. Os: I need to add to the laundry this. But I think we'll get better clarity. I'll wait until after um.

171
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.509
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, all court does to update this, so we can

172
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:23.929
Danno Ferrin: often off Call is going to be the battle to watch. I'm against it. But i'm not going to block it. But i'm not going to do it.

173
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.660
Danno Ferrin: Yeah,

174
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.409
Sally MacFarlane: I don't know much about that one.

175
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.820
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, awesome. Uh:

176
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.950
Sally MacFarlane: okay. So that's

177
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.879
Sally MacFarlane: uh it for Shanghai. So this Uh:

178
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.550
okay.

179
00:18:52.590 --> 00:19:00.440
Sally MacFarlane: So I think this is basically a discord channel already last week. So we've had some conversations um, internally about

180
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:06.200
Sally MacFarlane: stability in basic and performance. Um. So basically this

181
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:16.979
Sally MacFarlane: did we skip the forty-eight forty-four prototyping section was still going to come in

182
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:24.039
Sally MacFarlane: doing some prototyping with base to. I think I think there's a telegram channel. So if you

183
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:32.289
Sally MacFarlane: I hate telegram, But i'm going to have to get over it.

184
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:40.569
Danno Ferrin: Oh, yeah, if you could share that, that might be relevant. I I don't know I can participate. But I just want to be a fly on the wall on that one,

185
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.490
Sally MacFarlane: sure. Yeah. So Ping Helen about that.

186
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:44.909
Danno Ferrin: Okay, Thank you.

187
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.960
Sally MacFarlane: Uh,

188
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.979
Sally MacFarlane: yes, a stability. And so we've had it.

189
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.099
Sally MacFarlane: Basically a bit of a bind up here on um.

190
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:11.329
Sally MacFarlane: You know what's hard. He's back with stability right now. What people are complaining about this code? Um, that sort of thing and performance as well. So there's lots of ideas of um things that people want to.

191
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:18.359
Sally MacFarlane: You know how people want to solve those problems. I think Matt and Helen have um

192
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:25.369
Sally MacFarlane: done some work about creating epics, and uh hopefully prioritizing those. So I

193
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:33.079
Sally MacFarlane: I think that should show up on this public, then how board eventually, but maybe not quite yet.

194
00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.610
Sally MacFarlane: Uh,

195
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.000
Sally MacFarlane: so I think the epics should be public.

196
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.199
Sally MacFarlane: I'm just not sure how it looks yet to um

197
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.070
Sally MacFarlane: to public eyes. So I think we might just still have better work to there. But

198
00:20:53.290 --> 00:21:02.089
Sally MacFarlane: basically this stability and performance um based on if people have other ideas, I saw um at least one coming from

199
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.810
Sally MacFarlane: um.

200
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.509
Danno Ferrin: I only have one comment.

201
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.630
Sally MacFarlane: Uh:

202
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.520
Sally MacFarlane: yeah, but it it just gives a bit of a an

203
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:17.480
Sally MacFarlane: a um an insight into um what we're thinking there. And uh,

204
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:24.019
Sally MacFarlane: but hopefully, it should translate more concretely into a bit of a roadmap view. Soon

205
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.750
Sally MacFarlane: any questions on that.

206
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.880
Sally MacFarlane: So that's it for the agenda. Does anyone have any.

207
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.300
Sally MacFarlane: Let's take that.

208
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.860
Sally MacFarlane: No

209
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.970
Sally MacFarlane: cool.

210
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.029
Sally MacFarlane: Uh, I will get that um

211
00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.399
Sally MacFarlane: the release process. Um

212
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.029
Sally MacFarlane: document like that

213
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.350
Sally MacFarlane: for you done,

214
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.950
Sally MacFarlane: and that's it, if nothing else we can

215
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:25.999
Sally MacFarlane: that Are you in the Us. Are these times correct for you? But gonna you know, in they're correct for this. Yeah, Now we're back in sync.

216
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.569
Sally MacFarlane: So does that mean they were wrong for the last few months.

217
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.860
Sally MacFarlane: And now that the Us. That right

218
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:42.889
Danno Ferrin: I don't know, I always just go to that times and seasons put in the date and time, and check it out because it's. I don't know. I know Europe and American

219
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:50.039
Danno Ferrin: uh savings Summertime are different, and I think it's even different from Australia. So I don't know what's going on with it.

220
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:57.320
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah. Well, in Brisbane we don't change our clocks. Ever but in other Australia they do.

221
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.229
I always double check to.

222
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.320
Danno Ferrin: That's why when I first set these up

223
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:12.390
Danno Ferrin: they were originally fixed to a um utc time, so that way it was on. It was on the individual person to figure out

224
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.220
Danno Ferrin: what was going on with their local time.

225
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.420
Sally MacFarlane: Hmm.

226
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.860
Danno Ferrin: But it's migrated. So

227
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:23.770
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah,

228
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.039
we're trying to be helpful

229
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:31.500
Sally MacFarlane: just as long as it's communicated like a day ahead of time. It's

230
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.370
Sally MacFarlane: cool.

231
00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.709
Sally MacFarlane: Um, i'm gonna call it there. Thanks. Everyone,

232
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.310
Danno Ferrin: right? Thanks.

233
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.450
Jason Frame: Thanks.
