Simon Dudley: Hello!

2
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.050
Antoine Toulme: Hello!

3
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.440
Jason Frame: This might be it for today.

4
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.239
It's usually pretty quiet in this time.

5
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.679
Jason Frame: Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah,

6
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.919
Jason Frame: I don't know we right? So

7
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.910
Jason Frame: I think you can stop.

8
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.029
Jason Frame: We know we share as current. I think it is

9
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.270
mhm

10
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.530
Jason Frame: right. Thank you. So

11
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.130
Jason Frame: okay, started it.

12
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.340
Jason Frame: Okay,

13
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.630
that

14
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:32.890
Jason Frame: alright, let's start with the housekeeping. So so the anti-trust policy. Um, I think everyone said, where are they

15
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:49.110
Jason Frame: so i'll skip past that to remind that it's been recorded. I want to be a list of speaking, and uh, you say handpage, or the pretty small call today, so I don't think that's pretty much an issue.

16
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:59.070
Jason Frame: So let's start with. So, general announcements, there's got nothing but something on the agenda here today. Won't. Have any general announcements they would like to make.

17
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.700
Jason Frame: Okay,

18
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.029
Jason Frame: we've got a remarkable view, but I don't think that's been updated. I'll just check that. Um

19
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.899
Jason Frame: Yeah. Last was on August eleventh, So I don't think there's any any changes in the room that to look at. Uh. So let's say one one that

20
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.249
I think it makes sense to

21
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.739
Jason Frame: so look at that

22
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.110
Jason Frame: Sorry

23
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.719
Jason Frame: we did have some

24
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.279
Jason Frame: details here on the release update side.

25
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.430
Jason Frame: So the twenty-two

26
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.050
Jason Frame: I see one has gone out Um! Recently. Um!

27
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.370
Jason Frame: So that's great starting on the the new series. Um!

28
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.690
Jason Frame: So you won't have any

29
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.330
Jason Frame: comments, or when I don't talk about that at all on Oh,

30
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.180
Jason Frame: is there any particular changes that we're having to get in for the twenty dot dot ten to zero um series, or

31
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:17.300
Sally MacFarlane: I notice there's an item further down under work updates um about trying to get Java Seventeen update into two.

32
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.870
Sally MacFarlane: I'm not sure how feasible that is. How far along that

33
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.029
Sally MacFarlane: working. I'm not sure if there's any Boxers on that one.

34
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.220
Jason Frame: Okay, you know, is that one Actually, Do you know who's working on the and getting job seventeen? Or is that just something that we'd like to get in.

35
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.200
Sally MacFarlane: Then I was driving it. I'm just not sure where it's up to. I know some.

36
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.130
Okay.

37
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:55.020
Sally MacFarlane: It's good how to you update on that thing at the moment with that down here, and We' to take the discussion.

38
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.090
Jason Frame: Yeah, yeah, sorry.

39
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.720
Jason Frame: All right. This discussion in the

40
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.650
Jason Frame: Okay,

41
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.849
Jason Frame: I guess the release uh just to a channel,

42
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.300
Jason Frame: and they

43
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:28.979
Jason Frame: this moon, will they, will they some nice They We got the twenty-eight dot seven dot six that went out and had that hot fix in there for the um one cache um fix.

44
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.439
Jason Frame: So that's great. Um!

45
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.269
Jason Frame: I feel that we, the last of the holy we need to do

46
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.850
Jason Frame: um.

47
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.320
Jason Frame: They're doing one more time. So anything about that release? So

48
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.930
Jason Frame: um, we think we're not in here or not.

49
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.739
Jason Frame: Yeah, familiar with it other than the nine Um,

50
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.310
Jason Frame: the move to Github, c. I.

51
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.000
Jason Frame: Does anyone know where that is at the moment?

52
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.810
Antoine Toulme: Yeah, really. So

53
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.940
Antoine Toulme: been working on this on enough. Um! It's pretty close uh

54
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.590
Antoine Toulme: I was having one issue with the acceptance that I think it fixed. Uh,

55
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:22.920
Antoine Toulme: if you let me put in a chair. There is a reference to the outstanding Pr. For this.

56
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.150
Let me see it

57
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.310
here.

58
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.350
Antoine Toulme: So

59
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.620
Antoine Toulme: nice Chat.

60
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.289
Antoine Toulme: Okay, um.

61
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.020
Antoine Toulme: So

62
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.509
Antoine Toulme: let me see. This has been replaced of the latest lane, I think

63
00:06:51.780 --> 00:07:06.320
Antoine Toulme: it still is already of out of luck. Um! There are two issues. One is the build arm sixty-four docker, which is taken looking to, and another one is that the acceptance test are a little frivolous sometimes. Still,

64
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:14.069
Antoine Toulme: so they give me. They give me some trouble. Um. One of them, for example, just got stuck for thirty minutes today,

65
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:25.859
Antoine Toulme: and then that kind of cancelled the whole bill. But I think we're fairly close. Um, I wanted to make sure we built consensus on that. So it's not you surprised this is happening?

66
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.189
Antoine Toulme: Um, Do you have any questions for me about any of that.

67
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.150
Jason Frame: So you

68
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.960
Jason Frame: this to replace the um.

69
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.190
Antoine Toulme: Yes, yeah.

70
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.940
Jason Frame: What um is there an impact on the bill? Time using?

71
00:07:48.630 --> 00:08:00.209
Antoine Toulme: Um? I don't think so. Um. So the build itself is actually very fast if you, if you go to it and look at the checks. Um! There is a

72
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.079
Antoine Toulme: there should be on it.

73
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.660
Jason Frame: Are you main from the from this? Um: Yeah.

74
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.240
Yep.

75
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.270
Jason Frame: Bye,

76
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:15.149
Antoine Toulme: I should be able to see it in the the Ci for click on here in checks.

77
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.690
Antoine Toulme: Then there is a a view

78
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.280
Antoine Toulme: of it.

79
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.449
Antoine Toulme: So you go go all the way back up, and um! There's

80
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:33.499
Antoine Toulme: click on that. Now in the checks you can click on Ci in the on your left at the bottom.

81
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.450
Jason Frame: Okay, and click on that

82
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:42.010
Antoine Toulme: nice going to show you a picture of what the prioritization level is

83
00:08:42.360 --> 00:09:00.300
Antoine Toulme: so. What's pretty interesting here is that we're able to capitalize and reuse the artifacts. We can do a different steps. The compile step, for example is going to compile the code down and then hash it out and make sure that Sorry create a hash of the compiled class files, so that it's able to reuse them later.

84
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:06.389
Antoine Toulme: Uh which makes integration test, for example, very fast. Um same for assemble

85
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.889
Antoine Toulme: the test and windows also.

86
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.119
Antoine Toulme: Um. This helps This helps go much much faster.

87
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.940
Antoine Toulme: Um! So the panel test is the the matrix of the bomb,

88
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.790
Antoine Toulme: and you can see we we have like eight runners right Now

89
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:30.490
Antoine Toulme: most of them takes five, four, three. There's only one runner which is really slow. It's ninety minutes.

90
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.269
Antoine Toulme: Um! So the idea is to,

91
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.690
Antoine Toulme: and of course, when it got stuck in good, you know, ten out thirty minutes.

92
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:49.750
Antoine Toulme: So the idea is to get faster to the of resolution. We're able to see one of the fails happen. Um! And then very quickly, uh start with, you know, responding to that.

93
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.339
Antoine Toulme: Um, by all means. This is not perfect in this love.

94
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:58.519
Antoine Toulme: The checks themselves are happening outside into a different workflow.

95
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:07.489
Antoine Toulme: So we could also decide that this is not what we want, and we want to have different files for this. But this allows us to kind of

96
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.709
Antoine Toulme: go quickly about those, the steps.

97
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.730
Okay.

98
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.790
Antoine Toulme: So if you Oh, sorry alright, i'll come back. Um.

99
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:31.850
Antoine Toulme: So if you just cool down on on that page which might Yes, you can keep scrolling down you'll see that uh, even more uh you'll see that we are actually capturing artifacts. Part of this,

100
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:49.599
Antoine Toulme: and we are able to get some metadata. From. From all this information we can get the the journey test themselves become available to us as the files you can download uh to open up, and then you also have the bt to start seeing additional information different summaries.

101
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.130
Antoine Toulme: Uh, you can even see if caching is actually being reused or not. So

102
00:10:54.790 --> 00:11:00.540
Antoine Toulme: this is. This is so much as for because it shows whether the bill was actually um performance or not.

103
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.730
Okay,

104
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.390
Jason Frame: So we just need um.

105
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.720
Antoine Toulme: The final question.

106
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.870
Jason Frame: That's right.

107
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:24.939
Antoine Toulme: And just in a final push I need to fix those two things. Uh, it seems like the docker build is escaping you again, and I need to fix the exceptions test that uh seem to be stuck on one thing,

108
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.550
Antoine Toulme: and then we we might be in good shape.

109
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:35.330
Antoine Toulme: Oh, for the acceptance test! I was wondering if we're still running to be if you test it's part of a

110
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.539
Antoine Toulme: in the chrome acceptance. This, or are we? Are we no longer doing that

111
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.209
Antoine Toulme: because they are feeling?

112
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:55.719
Sally MacFarlane: Uh? Can you share information about which test specifically are failing. Is it acceptance that we're running?

113
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:13.230
Antoine Toulme: So maybe i'm asking you the same question. We just awesome. I like passing right now in Ci. I I mean the way I see this right now. We're currently running a maven uh plugin test. This is chrome acceptance test, and it's running it through a set of big files, apparently

114
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.739
Antoine Toulme: one of them. For some reason it's not always the same. One

115
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:24.319
Antoine Toulme: seems to be a little wiggly for some reason, so i'm not sure if it's the nature of us running it in Github. Um

116
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:30.310
Antoine Toulme: um. There seems to be some sitting there. There. It's just. There's just one failure at this point.

117
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:43.389
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah. So I think we were previously running those on Ps through Ci the circle. Ci. But um like you've been. So there was some flicking is there, so we switch to running it in a nightly

118
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.570
Sally MacFarlane: bill through Circle Ci um!

119
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.020
Sally MacFarlane: So right now we're not running on Every pr

120
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:56.049
Antoine Toulme: net is I'll. I'll just remove them from the from the Ci, because that's

121
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.599
Antoine Toulme: not if not needed anymore.

122
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.879
Antoine Toulme: And then they will take care of my video. For instance.

123
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.070
Antoine Toulme: Thank you.

124
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.360
Okay,

125
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.769
Antoine Toulme: It's great news. This work for me.

126
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.050
Jason Frame: Yeah, that's good.

127
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.520
Jason Frame: So that sounds like It's pretty question There,

128
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.129
Antoine Toulme: Yeah, I just wanted to let you know this happening, and if you have any questions about

129
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.020
Antoine Toulme: why, how?

130
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.999
Antoine Toulme: Um, please let me know. It's a good time.

131
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.589
Sally MacFarlane: So I I had a question around um

132
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:38.809
Sally MacFarlane: the like financial side of it, like I know that we weren't really sure how the cost was going to compare with Secleci versus Github actions.

133
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.340
Antoine Toulme: So Github actions is free,

134
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.739
Antoine Toulme: which is pretty unbeatable.

135
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.200
Sally MacFarlane: So I I understood that it was free up to a point.

136
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.600
Sally MacFarlane: But it in your it's like, Is it free for you?

137
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.040
Antoine Toulme: No, I think it's free,

138
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:07.630
Antoine Toulme: because this is a public resource, and this is a public uh repository. It is free

139
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.640
No,

140
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:28.380
Antoine Toulme: to to completely answer your question, because it i'm not trying to miscomp for anything it's We are using a specific machine for some of the docker builds especially for for for for even for native bills uh, because based on native moved over to using Github Ci and um

141
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:37.490
Antoine Toulme: for that one we had to get a Mac um machine. It's it could have done a better job. But the repository so

142
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:55.560
Antoine Toulme: hard to work with that it was easier to just say one particular os in architecture. It's going to be one version of the build, and we're going to run all four bills and then get the combination of all those bills as out to it, and then combine them into ours. Right? So.

143
00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:06.140
Antoine Toulme: Um, So that one we are being for a runner, a runner, because you can actually, with with Github you can choose to use your own hardware to run your tests

144
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:20.160
Antoine Toulme: Right? So um for for those um we are using one runner, which is actual M. One machine that is hosted and paid for by the Hyper Ledger Foundation. However, it's a fixed cost, not

145
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.100
Antoine Toulme: not really to how many how much we use it. It's also shared across many projects and a hybrid.

146
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:31.690
Antoine Toulme: So it's kind of a great architecture to kind of shape from that makes sense.

147
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.970
Sally MacFarlane: Thanks anyone.

148
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:45.739
Jason Frame: So the cost to be produced then, because it's mostly, for example, that runner Um, which is a shared cost

149
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.669
Antoine Toulme: because it should be negligible.

150
00:15:48.850 --> 00:16:00.530
Antoine Toulme: I think you might make things a little easier in terms of debugging sometimes or less. You know people have moved on to use get to actions across many, many workflows. That's what I use my day job.

151
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.290
Antoine Toulme: Um, I would hope that it helps contributors

152
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.860
Jason Frame: we are.

153
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.650
Jason Frame: It's it?

154
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.780
Jason Frame: Uh yeah, Thank you for the up down there, and that's good. It sounds like It's. As for request. Um,

155
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:51.000
Simon Dudley: I have a question about the parallelism. Um! So it looks like just looking at the Pr: It looks like the um. It's the unit test. And the reference test that are paralyzed at the moment is the Am I reading number. Right?

156
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.959
Antoine Toulme: Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

157
00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.129
Simon Dudley: Is it possible? And is there a plan to um do the same with the acceptance test?

158
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:08.780
Antoine Toulme: So the way we uh This is a good question. The way we do the polarization is we we find all the

159
00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:21.559
Antoine Toulme: let me go slowly, so I remember at the same time. Um. We find all the source test, Java, for all of the modules in grow. Then

160
00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:43.889
Antoine Toulme: from there we back out, and we find um. We recreate the instructions for gruddle right? So if you have a module under the Evm, let's say, then, Edm. Test is the desk you would call. Then we need to find that there's a source test. Java and Vm. Then from there on we we do a little bit of I can reg it to to eventually get back to a string that says,

161
00:17:43.900 --> 00:18:00.669
Antoine Toulme: you know Ivm test. So then we do that for all the modules, and that creates a long list of all the projects and all the test tests. Then we use a plugin from from Github actions in action itself that splits this list across and gives us um different

162
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:09.280
Antoine Toulme: different runners, right? So each runner now gets uh a part of that list. The acceptance test are in one module.

163
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:25.619
Antoine Toulme: So if we wanted to analyze on that we would need to apply the same approach. But it would be a bit more complicated, because I would need to go into the sense of this and find out how to create a list of all the tests there, and how to then split that least across um.

164
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:36.500
Antoine Toulme: I felt that was probably not going to be necessary. Here is why the exception to themselves take about eleven minutes to execute, when some of you need to take up to twenty minutes,

165
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.620
Antoine Toulme: so

166
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:45.610
Antoine Toulme: we could. Probably, I think there's actually one project, one module which is responsible for the brunt of the load

167
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.790
Antoine Toulme: in the test. So it's difficult to cut that down.

168
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.150
Antoine Toulme: But we could.

169
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.729
Simon Dudley: Okay, Thanks. That's interesting.

170
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.420
Yeah,

171
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:07.660
Antoine Toulme: it was fun to play with. If you look, if it can run this guitar thing about fifty times

172
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:31.370
Jason Frame: it won't be it for the release updates. Um, I think we've already done some of the workup dates, but um, we don't have some other ones in here. Um! We don't talk about the Java Seventeen um going to the twenty-two

173
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.400
Jason Frame: You know we're gonna have that with the discussion the discovery Channel um.

174
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.050
Jason Frame: I guess we'll just have to.

175
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.110
Jason Frame: We'll have that discussion there. I don't think anyone who is actually working here today.

176
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.120
Jason Frame: Are there any other work updates that they want to talk about in school.

177
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.590
Jason Frame: Okay?

178
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.439
Jason Frame: And

179
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:08.900
Sally MacFarlane: oh, there's not one there. So I I just said it So that's the Pr. To um the Java Seventeen. That's the link to the javascript. Yeah,

180
00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.320
Sally MacFarlane: just just for complaints. Um,

181
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.070
Sally MacFarlane: yeah. So I decided there's two proposed Um.

182
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:29.669
Sally MacFarlane: Yes, I've been providing for proposed changes to my maintenance. So maybe one person to emeritus and adding one maintainer, I think everyone on this call is already voted. But just for

183
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.209
Jason Frame: okay, yeah, so you could, if everyone can. Um add that back to this.

184
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.399
Jason Frame: Is there anything else? Any other business?

185
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:49.679
Jason Frame: Okay, it looks like That's everything's on the agenda. So if no one else has a has anything else, I think that's it for today.

186
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:56.620
Simon Dudley: Bye, bye,
