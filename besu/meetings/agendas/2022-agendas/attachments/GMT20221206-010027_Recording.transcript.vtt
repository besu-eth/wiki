Simon Dudley: Hello.

2
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.850
Jason Frame: Hello!

3
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.339
Simon Dudley: It's about a few minutes to

4
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.650
Simon Dudley: to the right.

5
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.449
Simon Dudley: Hi! Summon.

6
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.970
Sally MacFarlane: Hello!

7
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.979
Simon Dudley: I think we might be expecting Gary, but not done it.

8
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.779
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, Just so, Dennis message that he probably wasn't gonna make it.

9
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.179
Sally MacFarlane: We have a pretty packed agenda.

10
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.059
Simon Dudley: Yeah, there's quite a lot to cover.

11
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.180
Jason Frame: Yeah, it's good.

12
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.020
Simon Dudley: Hi, Jenny!

13
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.460
Zhenyang Shi: Hello!

14
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.840
Simon Dudley: Just give Gary in a minute.

15
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.380
Simon Dudley: Okay, I think i'm going to stop.

16
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.770
Simon Dudley: So this is the gender.

17
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.590
Simon Dudley: Let me know if you can't see this.

18
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.460
Sally MacFarlane: it's a bit small.

19
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.830
Simon Dudley: How's that?

20
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.619
Sally MacFarlane: That's better? Yeah, that's

21
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.670
Simon Dudley: cool. So

22
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.259
Simon Dudley: this is a but you said my contribut to call sp of housekeeping to start.

23
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.369
Simon Dudley: there's an anti-trust notice. Please read it and abide by it.

24
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.999
Simon Dudley: this meeting is being recorded.

25
00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.540
Simon Dudley: and

26
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.150
yes.

27
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.069
Simon Dudley: that's good enough. I can't see car yet, but let's stop. Is there any general announcements

28
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.480
Simon Dudley: release updates

29
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.409
Simon Dudley: 22.10 point 1 which I think was

30
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.659
Simon Dudley: a normal dot release. But it was maybe slightly delayed.

31
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.280
Simon Dudley: because of the no issue on the main bunch.

32
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.969
Simon Dudley: then, and maybe she cropped up after the release, so that was in swift

33
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.379
Simon Dudley: half fixed with 22.10 to a day or 2 later. I think

34
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.160
Simon Dudley: Does anyone want to speak to either of these.

35
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.070
Sally MacFarlane: No, I think I think you summarized it. Well, i'm not sure

36
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:20.200
Sally MacFarlane: like just as you're facilitating someone. I'm taking a step back. I'm. I'm. Not sure what the purpose of this section is. Is it just to summarize releases that have happened, or should we

37
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.699
have specific

38
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.509
Sally MacFarlane: objectives that we want to talk about there, or is it just a summary?

39
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.349
Simon Dudley: Yeah, it's a good question. I'm not sure.

40
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.989
Simon Dudley: I guess it might spot

41
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.920
Simon Dudley: specific discussion about

42
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.939
Simon Dudley: things up in the release, but I think probably

43
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.339
Simon Dudley: all of us on the call at least know about it, and I think it was discussed on

44
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.850
Simon Dudley: I see

45
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:52.469
Simon Dudley: on the discount channels as well. So to have an office. Probably all the discussions on there.

46
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.489
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I guess the next upcoming release would be 22 tenth already, which should be

47
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.530
Sally MacFarlane: plan for next week.

48
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.620
Simon Dudley: Yes, next Wednesday.

49
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.260
Yeah.

50
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.159
Jason Frame: Yeah. I think we often use this to talk about the upcoming release, and I think it might be

51
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.509
Jason Frame: needed for that device

52
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.129
Jason Frame: as much they want.

53
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.040
Simon Dudley: Okay.

54
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.319
Sally MacFarlane: Oh, so we don't have anyone on the Rel Rotations page for that release.

55
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.530
Sally MacFarlane: That's it.

56
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.229
Sally MacFarlane: The call for volunteers I yet

57
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.430
Simon Dudley: Okay.

58
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.600
Simon Dudley: and I

59
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.429
Simon Dudley: it's called as well.

60
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.550
Simon Dudley: So the next. Anything more about the release, or should I move on to the next section?

61
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.739
Simon Dudley: They all

62
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.579
Simon Dudley: So yeah, work updates. we've got Shanghai

63
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:27.279
Simon Dudley: there's a planning document. that's on your place with.

64
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.429
Simon Dudley: Sorry I

65
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:41.619
Simon Dudley: I think it's mostly up to date. it might be a few things. I'm not sure about the laundry this things, but I think everything in the shortlist is up to date.

66
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.610
Simon Dudley: And then I just gave an update on the

67
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.530
Simon Dudley: this cool channel about

68
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:57.419
Simon Dudley: he's aiming to do so, that this Pr. Is the small era, and he's aiming to do big the Us.

69
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:05.440
Simon Dudley: By getting to My, I think, he said, this week end of this for you.

70
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.569
Simon Dudley: So I put modes in its mouth.

71
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:12.800
you

72
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.130
Gary Schulte: quick question.

73
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.519
Gary Schulte: Okay, does it?

74
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:22.860
Gary Schulte: It's big. Ef: preclude small. I like what we have to make code changes not to only support small you.

75
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.790
Simon Dudley: Okay, Bye.

76
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.049
Simon Dudley: To be honest, I don't know much about it.

77
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.929
Simon Dudley: But the reason I was linked to this document. So maybe that i'll explain

78
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.030
Simon Dudley: what the plan is.

79
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.389
Simon Dudley: but yeah, he was saying.

80
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.020
Simon Dudley: he's targeting basically main branch being complete for the launch of the death net next week.

81
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.339
Simon Dudley: Not sure exactly which state that's plum for. But i'm guessing it might be a bit fluid.

82
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.859
Simon Dudley: But yeah, I think all the other aviation things are in main already.

83
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:20.290
Simon Dudley: withdrawals is in progress. This is linking to the epic with a few different issues in touch now. And

84
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.100
Simon Dudley: 4, 8, 4, 4 is in progress as well.

85
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.589
Simon Dudley: So yeah that's the planning document. The we still talked about the

86
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.770
Simon Dudley: with withdrawals. so one of the

87
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:49.750
Simon Dudley: one of the Pr. That's come out that is the addition of the Shanghai timestamp, and and the ability to support that. That's pretty close to

88
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.939
Simon Dudley: Then you may

89
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.630
Simon Dudley: and

90
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.120
Simon Dudley: I expect that will be in this week.

91
00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:07.470
Simon Dudley: and then we'll be able to pull that code into the other withdrawals here. and try and get that across into Main as well. at least starting this week as well

92
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.400
Simon Dudley: separately. This

93
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.559
Simon Dudley: some work to get there's a hive test draft of the withdrawals.

94
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.609
Simon Dudley: Some tests for the withdrawals. It's it's very much a draft. It's being added to

95
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.239
Simon Dudley: i'm not sure how much we should rely on

96
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.949
Simon Dudley: on the test, because you know, things are still changing as people into

97
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.799
Simon Dudley: but it's giving us some early indication of the potential bugs.

98
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.669
Simon Dudley: One question I had around that was

99
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.650
Simon Dudley: because since we're changing the engine api as part of withdrawals

100
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.990
Simon Dudley: is

101
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.080
Simon Dudley: like.

102
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:54.239
Simon Dudley: Can we rely on the the engine? Api? 5 tests that are existing as a regression

103
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.500
Simon Dudley: or

104
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.109
Simon Dudley: So take notice

105
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.589
Simon Dudley: we're not passing everything. This this there's also 2 5 tests.

106
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.790
Simon Dudley: Got it

107
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.410
Simon Dudley: What? I'm too.

108
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.560
Simon Dudley: but high test to seem to be

109
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.710
Simon Dudley: the engine api things.

110
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.220
Simon Dudley: and say

111
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.740
Simon Dudley: it looks like they might be failing

112
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.690
Simon Dudley: a few of them.

113
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:29.640
Simon Dudley: so I don't know if there is a plan to get those passing that's going on separately

114
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.439
Simon Dudley: is I know what I

115
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:38.680
Sally MacFarlane: my team team revenue. We've been looking at the Rpc. And I've seen compat

116
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.080
Sally MacFarlane: test suites

117
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.560
Sally MacFarlane: because they said that he was there. But that's they're different to me into one.

118
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.030
Simon Dudley: Okay.

119
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.140
Sally MacFarlane: And and the families that are mostly around it. Edge cases in their handling.

120
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:55.160
Simon Dudley: Okay.

121
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.140
Simon Dudley: Okay.

122
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:29.219
Sally MacFarlane: I I guess we could expand the as well to look at the engine. api test suite

123
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.490
Sally MacFarlane: as well.

124
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.099
Simon Dudley: Possibly it seems like we should. Probably

125
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.549
Simon Dudley: I need to pass them all. But obviously that's much of

126
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:45.210
Simon Dudley: prioritization. I guess it. Does anyone disagree that we should AIM to to have them over hive test, passing

127
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.939
Sally MacFarlane: The the only reservation there that I have is that

128
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.310
Sally MacFarlane: it always seems to be comparative

129
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.819
Sally MacFarlane: all of the clients to get, and in some cases with the

130
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.050
Sally MacFarlane: come to the conclusion that

131
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:10.309
Sally MacFarlane: you know, but basis doing the right thing, and and guess should change what what they're doing in some cases.

132
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.030
Simon Dudley: right?

133
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:16.150
Sally MacFarlane: So. So I guess we don't just want to, bluntly, you know, make on the test screen.

134
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.809
Sally MacFarlane: I think critically about what? What? I

135
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.420
Simon Dudley: Yeah.

136
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:30.319
Simon Dudley: Yeah, that's funny. I i'm wondering if that could be the case for the withdrawals host as well. That is, maybe been based on one client's implementation. It was early on.

137
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:37.570
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, and in in some cases as well, there's been, you know, he has pushed to the hard test repo itself to Change the way that

138
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:40.990
that

139
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:47.580
Jason Frame: hive test, for the withdrawal is very much for our being worked on. So I think we have to be careful, taking

140
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.110
Jason Frame: what tests are they on there at the moment.

141
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.490
Yeah.

142
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.309
Simon Dudley: yeah. So my my concern is around with regressing

143
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.209
Simon Dudley: the the withdrawals changes regressing the existing engine. Api.

144
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.580
Simon Dudley: Yes, yeah, same. But we she's

145
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.380
Simon Dudley: we should maybe have a go at it.

146
00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.819
Simon Dudley: So we've got confidence in that.

147
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:25.199
Simon Dudley: Anything else on withdrawals, or I've test you know what I want to discuss.

148
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.020
Simon Dudley: Okay, so 4, 8, 4, 4

149
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.860
Simon Dudley: So it has been like one or 2 just started

150
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:52.010
Simon Dudley: so things are being kind of funded and and and picked out for this and the plan is to get

151
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.610
Simon Dudley: multiple of this working in parallel on this

152
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.860
Simon Dudley: and as a result we would

153
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.930
Simon Dudley: talking about, maybe having a

154
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.270
Simon Dudley: a channel to discuss it specifically.

155
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.919
Simon Dudley: and we're thinking maybe we could.

156
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:10.560
Simon Dudley: Yeah.

157
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:20.080
Simon Dudley: if people agree it would be a good place to do it would be on the Hyper ledger. Discord maybe create a channel there, or use one of the existing channels

158
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:25.119
Simon Dudley: not clear yet how not it might get, but it would be very specific to the 4

159
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.830
Simon Dudley: implementation in basic.

160
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.770
Simon Dudley: that possibly could be a useful thing to have

161
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.539
Simon Dudley: public like that, so that

162
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.950
Simon Dudley: you know people that might be attending get involved with the interrupt session.

163
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.669
Simon Dudley: might be able to

164
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.000
Simon Dudley: see what's going on? Have questions and things like that.

165
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.139
Simon Dudley: How do you feel? It's on that?

166
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.909
Jason Frame: what do we need a discount for this er but not the others.

167
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.930
because

168
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:06.200
Simon Dudley: it's gonna possibly involve quite a few people working in parallel.

169
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.859
Jason Frame: Yeah, we might be able to.

170
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.970
Jason Frame: Yeah, I I i'm not.

171
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.910
Jason Frame: But I think we necessarily need a separate channel right now. But

172
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:29.410
Simon Dudley: okay, well, I guess it makes sense to any great one if we actually need it rather than create one first.

173
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.500
Simon Dudley: so we can probably use an existing tunnel, and then

174
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.520
Simon Dudley: if it gets to noise and decides to create a set for Well.

175
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:44.289
Jason Frame: yeah, I I think that makes sense like if we get to noisy in the previous channel somewhere, we can move it out.

176
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.320
Jason Frame: so we

177
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.320
Jason Frame: I can check what to do that

178
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.760
Simon Dudley: that is

179
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:13.270
Simon Dudley: So this item here is sorry. Was there anything else about? All right?

180
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:26.169
Jason Frame: i'm pilot. I'm planning to pick up a a pace of that the champion for that to look at the transaction, and fairly fully

181
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.570
Jason Frame: before I

182
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.199
Jason Frame: But there's a lot of cases that are up for grabs.

183
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.130
Jason Frame: on that ticket that was mentioned.

184
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:45.580
Simon Dudley: Yeah, so that that ticket I guess it's like the epic for 4, 4 4 is is listed. Yeah.

185
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.049
Simon Dudley: and i'm almost to the

186
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.190
Simon Dudley: It's didn't sign up finding talking.

187
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.390
Simon Dudley: and it's

188
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.759
Sally MacFarlane: it, was that, an ask for a people to

189
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:04.240
Sally MacFarlane: take out pieces of that, or is it sort of all pointed out and under control?

190
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.820
Simon Dudley: That's a good question.

191
00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.370
Simon Dudley: I think there are things

192
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.450
Simon Dudley: that the reg to be picked up on

193
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.729
Simon Dudley: or like we'll, they will be soon.

194
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.640
Simon Dudley: not quite clear yet.

195
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:27.910
Simon Dudley: He's working on what? Because I think people are finishing some things. They're in progress first.

196
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.529
Simon Dudley: but it's yeah, it's definitely a discussion we can have with people that

197
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.020
Simon Dudley: 3. i'm gonna get involved.

198
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:39.769
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, I guess that that

199
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.820
Sally MacFarlane: conversation can happen and just go to, you know, if the specific options are out for Grab. So

200
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.929
Sally MacFarlane: you're looking to help.

201
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:54.740
Simon Dudley: I think that makes sense. I think the idea is to you know. Keep that treat that links issue as a kind of epic and

202
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.310
Simon Dudley: split up Pr. Or issues from it. As people are picking things up.

203
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.589
Simon Dudley: so it should hopefully be clear. Well, what is it isn't being done?

204
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:12.540
Gary Schulte: Would it make sense to start a 4, 8, 4, 4 thread on basic contributors, so it could keep that conversation kind of tight and tidy.

205
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.279
Simon Dudley: Yeah, we can start that as a threat. Yeah. In instead of a channel, then.

206
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.850
Simon Dudley: yeah.

207
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:26.689
Simon Dudley: I I it may be slightly too early. I'm not sure if this anyone other than nearing looking at it at the moment. But

208
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.149
Simon Dudley: So we I think by next week it probably will be.

209
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.760
Jason Frame: I don't think it's much happening at the moment. But yeah, I think that's right. Makes a lot of sense. we can.

210
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.060
Jason Frame: Few of us did.

211
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.129
Jason Frame: So. We'll plan to become Some cases it' be good to discuss that there?

212
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.130
Simon Dudley: Okay.

213
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.640
Simon Dudley: So I think on the last

214
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.330
Simon Dudley: for this. it was mentioned that

215
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.849
Simon Dudley: the client team should get a

216
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:30.270
Simon Dudley: kind of like finalized list of aip that we'd be happy to include alongside withdrawals in Shanghai

217
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.909
Simon Dudley: so I I mentioned that here I don't know if we're

218
00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.979
Simon Dudley: April 2

219
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.250
Simon Dudley: finalize that list right now. But I wanted to bring it up

220
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:50.229
Simon Dudley: because we should probably start thinking about this week, I think. Yeah, all code is this week isn't it?

221
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:59.010
Simon Dudley: I suspect it's going to be very similar to this list. I'm not sure whether the

222
00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.619
Simon Dudley: any of the items from the laundry list would be

223
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.100
Simon Dudley: included as well. I I guess

224
00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.859
Simon Dudley: if it's complete, I guess there's no harm in the same

225
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:12.530
Simon Dudley: it could be in there. But there might be other issues i'm not aware of why it shouldn't be in that. But

226
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.620
Simon Dudley: yeah, if anyone's got any thoughts on that.

227
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.870
Simon Dudley: It wants to discuss here

228
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.549
Jason Frame: what happens If

229
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.460
Jason Frame: they

230
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.620
Jason Frame: what goes into the icd changes.

231
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.190
Jason Frame: what? What? What's going to shake? My rather

232
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.829
Jason Frame: How about you? And I have to

233
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.020
Jason Frame: pile up on to get that. Get those?

234
00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.480
Simon Dudley: I I guess what we need to do is

235
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.400
Simon Dudley: states our case for what we think should be included, and what we got ready.

236
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.199
Simon Dudley: and maybe highlight anything we haven't got ready to be included in that

237
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.019
Simon Dudley: that feels like it would be a decision made in all.

238
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:59.599
Simon Dudley: but yeah, are you saying if if a decision was made in all that that

239
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.800
Simon Dudley: meant that we had to get something, and it wasn't ready what we do. That

240
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:09.030
Jason Frame: I was. But yeah. So I think if we have the discussion on this code,

241
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.160
Jason Frame: I guess. after the meeting.

242
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.800
Jason Frame: if that happens. And

243
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:19.960
Jason Frame: but you've got a good point there. I've got representation of this If the is there anyone from

244
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:28.489
Jason Frame: the basic teams come about to represent? They say that they call to make sure we get let them know what our status is, and what we're happy to go in.

245
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.950
Jason Frame: Really check on.

246
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:43.599
Gary Schulte: I know Dana has put forth a position at some point, and she but typically has, like the Wednesday prior to for us a Thursday, the All Court does, and the Wednesday Prior.

247
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:50.740
Gary Schulte: There's a kind of everybody on Tupa gets together. I Usually it's usually too early for me to join, so it might actually be Australia time zone. Friendly

248
00:23:52.670 --> 00:24:00.219
Gary Schulte: But that's where a lot of the discussion and, like consensus, is built about what the team position is going to be ahead of that. So

249
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:06.810
Gary Schulte: maybe we could make sure that we can get everybody that's involved in Shanghai in that

250
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.239
Gary Schulte: that is usually the Eip Study group is the me. But

251
00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.809
Gary Schulte: maybe there's a way I don't know if we could do that asynchronously to arrive with that consensus

252
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.360
Gary Schulte: on discord. But

253
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.170
Gary Schulte: a meeting might actually be more effective

254
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.110
Gary Schulte: if we can get time zones to work out

255
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:32.490
Simon Dudley: I was. I was planning on starting. If I don't discord about it a bit closer to the time.

256
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.079
Simon Dudley: but yeah, maybe that can turn into a

257
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:47.999
Simon Dudley: but yeah, it feels like we should probably come to some sort of consensus about the list of the ips.

258
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.730
Gary Schulte: yeah, there's

259
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.020
Gary Schulte: It's not a lot of time left. So

260
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:55.530
Gary Schulte: ahead and

261
00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.630
Gary Schulte: ahead of the call this week.

262
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.500
Simon Dudley: So

263
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.710
Simon Dudley: okay. Anything else on

264
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.879
Simon Dudley: We've also got Ci on here.

265
00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:53.190
Simon Dudley: not sure if anyone if that was carried out, or someone as I did that to discuss. But

266
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.510
Gary Schulte: i'm on Mobile so I can't tell who's here to Justin on the call.

267
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:06.489
Gary Schulte: Okay, I can kind of represent the status he's got with the Github actions this morning. He said that

268
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.090
Gary Schulte: everything except one of the Pk.

269
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.750
Simon Dudley: Oh.

270
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.229
Simon Dudley: or at least I can't hear you

271
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.909
Simon Dudley: and anyone else here.

272
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:29.229
Sally MacFarlane: No, I think we listen. I did see an update from Justin about. There was a

273
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:38.480
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, that was a specific test with Pki, I mean something that was consistently filing and github options, even though it was

274
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.590
okay.

275
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.309
Simon Dudley: Oh, yeah.

276
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:52.320
Sally MacFarlane: but yeah, I think it's the the web is progressing. Well, in general. there's just a few hurdles together.

277
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.989
Simon Dudley: Hi guys back. Hello!

278
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.779
Simon Dudley: So I can't hear you if you're speaking

279
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:25.379
Simon Dudley: Did anyone else want to mention anything about the Ci?

280
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.930
Simon Dudley: Thanks for that.

281
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:40.479
Simon Dudley: Okay, let's move on to our business. We can circle back to that very. We joined

282
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.110
Simon Dudley: Yes. So the next

283
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.129
Simon Dudley: one of these meetings a pack time

284
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.989
Simon Dudley: he schedules for third in January.

285
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.529
Simon Dudley: second of January and us.

286
00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.629
Simon Dudley: if there's no religion issues

287
00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.149
Simon Dudley: someone's proposing to be skipped.

288
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:01.640
Simon Dudley: Gt.

289
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.419
Simon Dudley: Thanks being on a right

290
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.659
Simon Dudley: Any objection to that on this call.

291
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.140
Gary Schulte: Sorry I understand.

292
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.609
Sally MacFarlane: I I propose that skipping the next

293
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.829
Sally MacFarlane: just after that years did I go? Commented in disc that he wouldn't be back from money

294
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.350
Sally MacFarlane: by that time.

295
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:36.900
Sally MacFarlane: and I I didn't see any other comment. So I haven't seen any injections to this yet

296
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.510
Simon Dudley: it

297
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.180
Jason Frame: quickly. Yeah.

298
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.170
exactly.

299
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.320
Simon Dudley: should we maybe mention it one more time in discord, and then

300
00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.550
Simon Dudley: if you're okay to talk, Gary, and we can go back to the Ci:

301
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:27.250
Gary Schulte: Yeah, you know, Sally, I heard I heard what Sally was saying. and she pretty much gave the same update. I was gonna give that this just that Pki Qbft. Test that that

302
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.740
Gary Schulte: Justin was having difficulty with, but otherwise

303
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.380
Gary Schulte: some very close Github actions is very close.

304
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.260
Right?

305
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:54.920
Simon Dudley: Thank you.

306
00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:01.649
Simon Dudley: So the time rotation and contribute to calls.

307
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.079
Simon Dudley: yeah, I

308
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.400
Simon Dudley: not entirely sure on the details of this.

309
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.540
Simon Dudley: Give an update about

310
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.500
Simon Dudley: As far as I understand this.

311
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.190
Simon Dudley: Maybe.

312
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.900
Simon Dudley: instead of having 2 calls it constant time, we're going to kind of.

313
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:28.289
Simon Dudley: We might end up with 3 time options. That is it that change, or

314
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.609
Sally MacFarlane: yes, I that was done. I's proposal, so

315
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:33.720
Sally MacFarlane: I

316
00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.440
Sally MacFarlane: proposed that we skip this and put it on the agenda for the next call.

317
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.169
Sally MacFarlane: Since then I was not here.

318
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.829
Sally MacFarlane: and with a lot of items on the agenda to cover.

319
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.280
Simon Dudley: so

320
00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:10.280
Simon Dudley: for me or rename based in notes this is one I've got on there at the moment. We've got on the Hyper Ledger discord. We've got a basic channel, and we've got basically notes. I think was

321
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:14.540
Simon Dudley: kind of originally created to split up some of the

322
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.659
Simon Dudley: node operational kind of conversations

323
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.860
Simon Dudley: that

324
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:21.130
Simon Dudley: when we had a lot of

325
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:25.979
Simon Dudley: uses asking things in discord during the during and off the merge.

326
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.999
Simon Dudley: and I think now they kind of

327
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.910
Simon Dudley: basically you know it just kind of used interchangeably to

328
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.839
Simon Dudley: depending on which user

329
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.709
Simon Dudley: so I don't think there's any meaningful split between them

330
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:47.669
Simon Dudley: which seems to me like we should have. Fold it back into one channel.

331
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:53.450
Simon Dudley: Robin, create and use the correction, or if people still see value in it.

332
00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:01.959
Simon Dudley: maybe renaming it, or or or getting some better indication of maybe what

333
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:10.179
Simon Dudley: the split should be. for example Me? Why I want to split up steak is from from the normal basic channel probably get rid of

334
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.070
Simon Dudley: Hello,

335
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.629
Simon Dudley: Those conversations, if anyone finds value in that. But I think if all the contributors are

336
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.900
Simon Dudley: looking at both channels, then it's kind of pointless. You might as well be on one.

337
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.890
Simon Dudley: Has anyone got any thoughts or objections to that?

338
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.829
Sally MacFarlane: I I agree that they use interchange for yeah, I think we should

339
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.769
Sally MacFarlane: it? It makes sense to me to follow them back into one channel.

340
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:44.389
Jason Frame: Yes, I I think we're just in that monitoring both terms, and some discussions can happen now.

341
00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.089
Sally MacFarlane: and it confuses you.

342
00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:49.850
Simon Dudley: Yeah.

343
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.330
Simon Dudley: It seems like a unnecessary friction at this point.

344
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.509
Simon Dudley: Got it?

345
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:12.049
Simon Dudley: I'll put like a phone to, or something on on discord to make the final decision.

346
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.450
Simon Dudley: Okay.

347
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.549
Simon Dudley: What does it generate to change about discussion

348
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.289
Simon Dudley: the next month, Originally the east of it?

349
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:43.860
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, that was a something that I threw out there as a Has anyone had an experience with this before I i'm

350
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:47.039
Sally MacFarlane: I don't think it's at the level where we

351
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.479
Sally MacFarlane: want to have this discussion in base.

352
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.230
Sally MacFarlane: You know that big a fish to fry right now?

353
00:33:54.740 --> 00:34:00.829
Sally MacFarlane: The why I raised it was there seem to be a lot of conflicts being generated by the change log itself.

354
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:06.449
Sally MacFarlane: because, you know, everyone with every Pr. Is adding to the last line of the change look

355
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.299
Sally MacFarlane: and I

356
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.089
Sally MacFarlane: throughout a different suggestion. That was basically sorting the change log

357
00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:16.120
Sally MacFarlane: by something. Whatever ordering makes sense. And

358
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:20.840
Sally MacFarlane: i'm not sure people are doing that, or just being more proactive about

359
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:27.820
Sally MacFarlane: resolving change on conflicts. But there seems to have been feel a complex sorry. I think it's fine.

360
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:41.899
Sally MacFarlane: For example, all the Eos changes have been grouped together in the 10 to the entries, which, like that, makes total sense.

361
00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.580
Simon Dudley: Cool.

362
00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.849
Simon Dudley: propose deprecation of good or privacy.

363
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:14.509
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah. So I've also posted a longer message about this in the basic contributors channel. But essentially

364
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:26.699
Sally MacFarlane: we have 3. Call 3 privacy modes in by 2, and one of them essentially is interoperable privacy with Go for them, and because of the

365
00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:30.990
Sally MacFarlane: to because of technical details. With that it. It.

366
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:38.860
Sally MacFarlane: It requires hooks quite deep into the transaction processing and block processing parts of the code base.

367
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.339
Sally MacFarlane: and

368
00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:47.979
Sally MacFarlane: that doesn't seem to be in a demand for that interoperable privacy marriage. So we don't take anyone to using it.

369
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.309
Sally MacFarlane: So we're proposing. You need to deprecate that

370
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.229
Sally MacFarlane: perhaps you might advise him

371
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.449
Sally MacFarlane: and if we

372
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:59.769
Sally MacFarlane: get the deprecation that is in the next quarterly release, then

373
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:09.009
Sally MacFarlane: it, as in 23 to one then we could remove that feature in 23.4, and that will remove a fair bit of friction for main that development.

374
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:17.190
Sally MacFarlane: So I guess putting it out there if there's thoughts, objections, and so forth.

375
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.640
Sally MacFarlane: Make them

376
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:38.359
Simon Dudley: doesn't sound like anyone has any got some objections at this point

377
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.819
Simon Dudley: sounds good to me.

378
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.579
Simon Dudley: I guess the any question would be, is there any impact on the go call

379
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.520
Simon Dudley: perfect?

380
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:49.480
Simon Dudley: So outside of basically.

381
00:36:51.010 --> 00:37:00.779
Sally MacFarlane: No. So people who are using Obviously, the Forum can continue to this policy. But when we're not proposing a changing.

382
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.649
Simon Dudley: and it it doesn't affect like any.

383
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.610
Sally MacFarlane: only for privacy.

384
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:09.819
Simon Dudley: Okay.

385
00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.700
Simon Dudley: cool. Thanks.

386
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:22.150
Simon Dudley: it, I guess. Maybe continue that

387
00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.580
Simon Dudley: and just go to where that would be. The next

388
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.879
Simon Dudley: may not out

389
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:37.159
Simon Dudley: and final one on the other business. Is this a. Pr. To as

390
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.960
Simon Dudley: Maintainer?

391
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:49.669
Simon Dudley: yeah, I think there's maybe 2 more base required. so if anyone hasn't voted, please do

392
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.060
Gary Schulte: I counted I kind of 13.

393
00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:53.990
Simon Dudley: Oh.

394
00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.370
Sally MacFarlane: that things enough.

395
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.539
Simon Dudley: I mean.

396
00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.380
Simon Dudley: I'm going to try it. My hand.

397
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.929
Jason Frame: That's right.

398
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.870
Simon Dudley: That's good.

399
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:09.899
Simon Dudley: Okay.

400
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.330
Simon Dudley: thanks.

401
00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.759
Simon Dudley: Okay. Next one I can form at least process and policy.

402
00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:34.700
Gary Schulte: Yeah, I put that on the agenda just because I think our current release process, at least, as we have interpreted

403
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.220
Gary Schulte: trunk based development where

404
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:45.310
Gary Schulte: main is always releasing, and therefore our release processes to release from Maine, I think, has

405
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.900
Gary Schulte: cause us to have some

406
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:51.249
Gary Schulte: release quality issues, since whatever we would

407
00:38:53.060 --> 00:39:02.060
Gary Schulte: do, extended testing, or you know, burn in on is a is a moving target. We're we're continually merging into main. So there's a

408
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.720
Gary Schulte: it just a challenge to having

409
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.910
Gary Schulte: confidence, or rather disproving the release of any particular commit.

410
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.819
Gary Schulte: And having some conversations

411
00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.890
Gary Schulte: with Adrian with folks on Chupo, with Sally, with Jason.

412
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.519
Gary Schulte: I think that

413
00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.899
Gary Schulte: we can stick with our

414
00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.749
Gary Schulte: trunk-based development approach where Maine is always releasing.

415
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.430
Gary Schulte: but we could just kind of tweak it a bit

416
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.120
Gary Schulte: to

417
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:39.790
Gary Schulte: Essentially give us time between cutting a release and making it official.

418
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:41.540
Gary Schulte: if we

419
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.509
Gary Schulte: where to cut a release

420
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:51.439
Gary Schulte: some days ahead of when the official release date is that would give us time to progressively burn in a a release and give us

421
00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.999
Gary Schulte: time to evaluate whether a release is

422
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.959
Gary Schulte: of sufficient quality to be considered a production release.

423
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:02.970
Gary Schulte: I could actually

424
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.279
Gary Schulte: Daniel

425
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.689
Gary Schulte: put together a

426
00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.730
Gary Schulte: kind of a

427
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.800
Gary Schulte: no, but it's it's a

428
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:22.810
Gary Schulte: I want to call the straw man. It's a it's a start at what a release process might look like, whereas today, we release.

429
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.089
Gary Schulte: say, on a Wednesday

430
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.319
Gary Schulte: we do an immediate cut from Maine.

431
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.759
Gary Schulte: and do a release, and we rely strictly on

432
00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:37.850
Gary Schulte: integration test acceptance tests basically our Ci pipeline to prove out that that releases is quality enough to be released.

433
00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.939
Gary Schulte: and what we are proposing

434
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:50.129
Gary Schulte: is that we would cut a release by by by a creating a release branch from Maine. So we're still releasing from Maine, but we do it some days in advance.

435
00:40:52.100 --> 00:41:01.459
Gary Schulte: and that would give us the opportunity to do progressive burning on various networks of increasing levels of traffic, increasing levels of economic

436
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:03.559
Gary Schulte: activity. And

437
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.709
Gary Schulte: really, you know, just value for the validators, and and we could

438
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.919
Gary Schulte: get better signal that way.

439
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:15.579
Gary Schulte: I think that we can do this in a really light touch minimal way where we continue to do

440
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.819
Gary Schulte: trunk-based development without

441
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.529
Gary Schulte: significantly impacting our processes. But we can

442
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.940
Gary Schulte: greatly and increase the quality.

443
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:32.710
Gary Schulte: So I kind of want to just float this out and get this on the on the agenda. I know we've had a lot of discussions in the past about our release process, and there's

444
00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:38.290
Gary Schulte: some differences of opinion. But I think that everybody agrees that

445
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.960
Gary Schulte: trunk based development is our goal.

446
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.360
Gary Schulte: and I think that we can. We can leverage trunk, based development and still give ourselves

447
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:50.599
Gary Schulte: time to to prove or disprove the release quality of any particular commit ahead of time.

448
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.820
Gary Schulte: So just kind of wanted to open the floor to that and see what folks had to say about it.

449
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:06.809
Jason Frame: I really like the idea, but give me a small time to test it. But in before the release, and

450
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:12.939
Jason Frame: don't like the fact of the current process, at least the way we many is that we have to

451
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:17.759
Jason Frame: maybe include changes that we haven't originally. Texted

452
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:24.699
Jason Frame: yeah better process. So I think this is a a big improvement. It's more time to have more stable.

453
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.619
Jason Frame: what I kind of wondering is

454
00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:35.549
Jason Frame: but this they use for the next release. That's plan to go out next week and Are there any changes that we need to

455
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:41.789
Jason Frame: do before the release could happen at the moment Like, is it comparable to current

456
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:46.999
Jason Frame: set up in terms of writing and everything else? It wasn't just a

457
00:42:48.000 --> 00:43:02.969
Gary Schulte: Yeah, I I think we could incrementally implement this. I mean, I think that it's to go with this process straight away. Is it so? Would be slightly manual in a couple of the steps, but I think that things could be automated a bit in terms of

458
00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.830
Gary Schulte: You know the the the burn and release testing

459
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.760
Gary Schulte: Maybe make things a bit more transparent as well. If

460
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.209
Gary Schulte: we want to have

461
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:24.559
Gary Schulte: a a vote, perhaps, or if there's a a thumbs up thumbs down from the contributors about Whether we think a release has sufficient quality to release. We need to be more transparent about

462
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.809
Gary Schulte: what we're basing those decisions on.

463
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:37.640
Gary Schulte: I I think that that's gonna take a little bit of effort to make those instances more transparent. The canary nodes the validator nodes etc. I maybe there's a way that we can do that.

464
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.659
Gary Schulte: that provides transparency without

465
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.350
Gary Schulte: necessarily.

466
00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.529
Gary Schulte: no, no. I mean

467
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:56.330
Gary Schulte: that's to be discussed, I think. But I I think if we're if we're all going to make a call collectively on the quality of our release, we need to, have those results more transparent.

468
00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:01.109
Gary Schulte: But that said, I think we can still do this process where we

469
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:05.000
Gary Schulte: cut a branch ahead of time and give it sufficient time to burn, and and

470
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.039
Gary Schulte: if it's manually sharing the results

471
00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:16.759
Gary Schulte: I think that that's an an acceptable workaround to do to get incremental progress towards quality. while we work on our

472
00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.789
Gary Schulte: automation and transparency.

473
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:24.770
Gary Schulte: I think there's some some tactical things as well regarding docker images

474
00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.190
Gary Schulte: that we don't want to overwrite latest.

475
00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:35.100
Gary Schulte: but I think that that's not going to be terribly difficult to resolve. if we release ahead of time, we don't want to impact what

476
00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.510
Gary Schulte: the

477
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.339
Gary Schulte: the latest basic releases.

478
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:49.600
Gary Schulte: So I I think that there's a little bit of work that needs to be done on the Ci pipeline there, but that's not anything that would block us to do to use this type of incremental process on the next release, which is scheduled for next week on Wednesday.

479
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.490
Gary Schulte: It's my personal opinion.

480
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:58.359
Sally MacFarlane: Yeah, I think. having the longer

481
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.080
Sally MacFarlane: time

482
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.890
Sally MacFarlane: is

483
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:11.059
Sally MacFarlane: really important. And yeah, as as you say, there's been some recent issues with releases that have only become apparent after that that burning

484
00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:24.060
Sally MacFarlane: has happened. So I think baking that into our release process would be awesome, and having that transparency. However, we provide that transparency of the results from that burning, if it's manual. For now I think that's that's cool.

485
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.459
Sally MacFarlane: but yeah, being being transparent and communicating that that would

486
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.799
Sally MacFarlane: an improvement

487
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:32.160
Sally MacFarlane: to how we do it right now.

488
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.010
Gary Schulte: Yeah, I think we're asking for for

489
00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.980
Gary Schulte: right now. We've just had exceptions. We

490
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.809
Gary Schulte: A couple of times I've

491
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.710
Gary Schulte: thrown something out onto the contributor channel and said, hey, we're

492
00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:50.739
Gary Schulte: We're seeing issues with this release.

493
00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.769
Gary Schulte: How do we feel about postponing. How do we feel about delaying

494
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:59.639
Gary Schulte: You know. How do we feel about a hot fix release to address the quality issues that we've had.

495
00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:05.519
Gary Schulte: And I think that in the absence of that transparency asking people for that type of feedback is.

496
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.669
Gary Schulte: Yeah, it's. It's not. It's not super effective. So

497
00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:10.560
Gary Schulte: no.

498
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.590
Gary Schulte: we definitely do a better job of making these results

499
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.439
Gary Schulte: viewable

500
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.459
Gary Schulte: by contributors, at least.

501
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:31.570
Simon Dudley: Yeah, i'm in agreement as well. But it's it seems like, the best repression. What we've currently got.

502
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:35.969
Simon Dudley: yeah, like

503
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:43.849
Simon Dudley: it. It doesn't make sense to me to release from main. If this things that like definitely untested on that.

504
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:48.330
Simon Dudley: So I would be for this as well.

505
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.090
Simon Dudley: I think maybe in terms of Can we do it for next week?

506
00:46:54.810 --> 00:47:02.029
Simon Dudley: the I mean it's worth asking. But it's possible, like if the expectation was that

507
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:03.459
Simon Dudley: things

508
00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:08.070
Simon Dudley: that we got on to main, that we have merged on to mainly by

509
00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.829
Simon Dudley: Wednesday would be released if that was is the current expectation.

510
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:23.780
Simon Dudley: and we are saying, we will shift it back to. When would it be this week, the Friday, the it would effectively, If we did this for the next release. It would be end of day. Friday. That was

511
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:29.850
Gary Schulte: tentatively when we would cut that release that we would burn in so progressively until Wednesday.

512
00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.120
Simon Dudley: Yeah.

513
00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:42.079
Simon Dudley: so yes, we should probably check with everyone that they're okay with that If it's going to be cut off on Friday instead of sometime next week.

514
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:50.079
Simon Dudley: I think we should maybe bear in mind the thing that I said in discord. I think

515
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:55.640
Simon Dudley: about trying to get something ready for a a definite next week.

516
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:58.700
Simon Dudley: That might be a consideration.

517
00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.780
Simon Dudley: and that was the

518
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.709
Gary Schulte: Yeah. I I think we can probably

519
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:15.789
Gary Schulte: continue this discussion on discord. I just kind of wanted to bring it up in a in an open forum. Just get a feel for where people are at with a little bit of a reinterpretation of

520
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.829
Gary Schulte: our release process. I want to.

521
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.879
Gary Schulte: Ideally, a light touch approach would be

522
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:23.720
Gary Schulte: a good incremental way forward.

523
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.979
Jason Frame: I think we just need to play one of those cast off.

524
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:41.609
Jason Frame: if we top this with the it's the releases rotations page to the the at least we could put it to cut off date. So

525
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.009
Jason Frame: no thanks.

526
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:15.290
Simon Dudley: Oh, thanks for that. Got it.

527
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.139
Simon Dudley: So that's good.

528
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:29.720
Simon Dudley: Did anyone want to discuss the

529
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.479
Gary Schulte: Is there news there?

530
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.589
Simon Dudley: Hi doing

531
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:49.279
Simon Dudley: That's updated?

532
00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:54.149
Simon Dudley: maybe it should get updated. I think this also a

533
00:49:54.630 --> 00:50:01.490
Simon Dudley: a public version of a send this board with a a basic roadmap on

534
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:10.240
Simon Dudley: I don't have a link to that to hand, and i'm not sure what the state of that is in terms of being public. I believe there is a version that is accessible.

535
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.319
Simon Dudley: But yeah, i'll maybe

536
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:22.370
Simon Dudley: leave that some of like that to to put a link on here. Maybe we should use that as the breakout going forward.

537
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.460
Jason Frame: I think it's on the top of that.

538
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.469
Simon Dudley: I really

539
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.430
Simon Dudley: Okay, Here we go. Thanks.

540
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.120
Simon Dudley: Yes, sorry. This is

541
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:50.000
Simon Dudley: probably a better one in our previous document. hopefully, more up to date.

542
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.650
Simon Dudley: Does anyone want to discuss that?

543
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:07.490
Simon Dudley: Okay.

544
00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.229
Simon Dudley: So any future topics?

545
00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.589
Simon Dudley: is there anything else at all.

546
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.990
Simon Dudley: Okay.

547
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:50.590
Simon Dudley: Thank you very much. there's a few things. Look out for updates on this

548
00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.310
Simon Dudley: update after this, I think

549
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.679
Gary Schulte: I don't. Thanks for facilitating.

550
00:51:57.570 --> 00:51:58.689
Simon Dudley: Hey, Hello!

551
00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:00.350
Simon Dudley: Have a good day.
