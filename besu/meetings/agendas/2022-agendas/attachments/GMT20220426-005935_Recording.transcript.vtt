13
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:49.260
Hart Montgomery: I think, is really the only other person here and he's followed this from the beginning to the point that i've listed him as a co author on that document.

14
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.050
Hart Montgomery: it's just sort of an expanded proposal of what TIM has written.

15
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.250
Hart Montgomery: With a bunch of extra details and some stuff that's useful for explaining.

16
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.680
Hart Montgomery: You know, things to people that aren't as familiar with the technical details.

17
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.090
Hart Montgomery: That was designed for essentially lawyers to read.

18
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.010
Sally MacFarlane: Right.

19
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.360

Hart Montgomery: If you have time.

24
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.820
Hart Montgomery: we've had a number of people look through it already but.

25
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.990
Hart Montgomery: If you're interested.

26
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.800

Sally MacFarlane: Okay.

28

Sally MacFarlane: Thank you.

29
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:56.850
Sally MacFarlane: i'm the roadmap I just had a quick look at the roadmap I think it's still needs more attention because coming up to 22 for.

30
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.120
Sally MacFarlane: Release and.

31
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.700
Sally MacFarlane: yeah, this is probably a little a little out of date.

32
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:19.170
Danno Ferrin: yeah so there wasn't much to do for the 22 dot 121 for release it was all in line for 24 mrc to.

33
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:29.940
Danno Ferrin: Gary wanted to hold it off because there was a consensus bug that I help them resolve Thursday morning Mike i'm busy evening your time and time for the.

34
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:41.100
Danno Ferrin: Hard work that the shadow work again and they're traveling back so I don't know how long we want to wait for Gary and come back and get back and coherence into working mode before we.

35
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.940
Danno Ferrin: And then the rest of the team for figure out when to do our cto there are changes that there is interested in and the vm work.

36
00:06:48.570 --> 00:07:00.570
Danno Ferrin: So I would like to get it to 24 oh and reasonable time frame the changes we did for the long and gas to get to have some some really positive garbage collection in high volume environments so.

37
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:10.380
Danno Ferrin: that's something that you know we like to do, but you know we gotta trust compassion for the international travelers I didn't want to fly to Amsterdam Easter week so.

38
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.840
Danno Ferrin: yeah be patient for those it shows you.

39
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.850
Sally MacFarlane: Say there's a.

40
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.950
Sally MacFarlane: bug fix that we need.

41
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.550
Sally MacFarlane: merged in before we can do it to.

42
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.710
Sally MacFarlane: The upshot.

43
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.700
Danno Ferrin: Is that.

44
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.520
Sally MacFarlane: And that the side of the consensus bug you were just talking about.

45
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.300
Sally MacFarlane: yeah it's already imagine just need you to develop.

46
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:32.250
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

47
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.560
Sally MacFarlane: i'm okay i'm.

48
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:49.080
Danno Ferrin: Good he is not on this call is, if we want to try and get the IPC rpc in RC two or three and over 2401 or 24 oh fcs.

49
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.660
Sally MacFarlane: yeah I think it would be good to get that one in I mean if you feel about that I don't.

50
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:04.650
Sally MacFarlane: Like it seems insignificant I did ask mark on my tablet look at it and then he I know he's halfway through.

51
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.550
Sally MacFarlane: But yeah I followed that up with him today.

52
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.210
Sally MacFarlane: Because yeah it would be good to get that in.

53
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.770
Danno Ferrin: That it's like you'd be surprised that people really want to use it so.

54
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.960
Danno Ferrin: yeah I was kind of surprised that.

55
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.040
Danno Ferrin: is actually possible with the Java, but just just an idea.

56
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:37.620
Sally MacFarlane: Mention.

57
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:55.770
Sally MacFarlane: So Lucas just pinged me about 24 zero, which is shadow the 30th of April, which is coming up quite quickly.

58
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.410
Sally MacFarlane: So is there.

59
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.030
Sally MacFarlane: Apart from those things we just talked about is there, other things that we're waiting on.

60
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.250
Sally MacFarlane: Between 2.0.

61
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.200
Danno Ferrin: Where i'm all the freaking changes around.

62
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.720
Sally MacFarlane: yeah, but if we if we wait a few more days before we do it to then, I guess, we should.

63
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.980
Sally MacFarlane: push 24 zero out like 30th of April to say.

64
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.020
Danno Ferrin: yeah at least give it a week.

65
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:31.800
yeah.

66
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.290
Sally MacFarlane: Okay, but everything's on track, we just want to wait a week off the ice to.

67
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:49.740
Sally MacFarlane: Go and.

68
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.980
Sally MacFarlane: Release rotations page.

69
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.870
Sally MacFarlane: Work updates about the feature backwards incompatible changes come come with that already done that right.

70
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:19.230
Danno Ferrin: yeah it's going to start with the notice and the 24 hour release that in 22 so we're going to go to Java 17 you give people full release cycle and so people don't want to go in as reconsidering.

71
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.370
Danno Ferrin: Our selection of jvm to the docker images.

72
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:36.540
Danno Ferrin: I know there's been some desire to get us on chairman is the default and they're proud of you good time to do it and rework some of the names of some of the conventions so that'd be the right time to do it probably will do the chapter 17.

73
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.370
Sally MacFarlane: Sorry, what was the one you just said, we should think about making.

74
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.960
Danno Ferrin: That was the one that open jdk to came I think it's Tara man i'm not sure exactly how it's spelled pronounce.

75
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.610
Danno Ferrin: Let me bring up my SDK.

76
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.310
Danno Ferrin: SDK this.

77
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.910

78
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.860
Danno Ferrin: Sorry, I was gonna I was on Amazon instance.

79
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.850
Sally MacFarlane: If it's not at your fingertips at the compensation.

80
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.800
Danno Ferrin: is coming right up here on T, you are, I am.

81
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:44.130
Danno Ferrin: That is what adopt open jdk to came and that's one of the more popular distributions as a baseline um it's not tied to any corporation like a Colorado it is we're open jdk is um, which is why are Zulu even which is like I said, some of the Community, like that, as a default.

82
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.040
Sally MacFarlane: The gas too long, is already.

83
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.330
Danno Ferrin: gets merged.

84
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.260
Sally MacFarlane: mentioned yep.

85
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.110
Sally MacFarlane: um.

86
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:15.270
Sally MacFarlane: I think this is a hangover from last time about the automated security requests.

87
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.280
Danno Ferrin: yeah it was a hold over there was no exciting deltas in it so.

88
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.580
Sally MacFarlane: No action for that.

89
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:24.990
Danno Ferrin: Right.

90
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.500
Sally MacFarlane: metrics.

91
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.300
Sally MacFarlane: Unless you guys really want to go through it, I might get up.

92
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.310
Danno Ferrin: there's more of a great thing.

93
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.460
Sally MacFarlane: I did just have a quick look there's nothing so let's do that.

94
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:58.200
Danno Ferrin: And so that was last week last week on the tsa to talk about new metrics per project reporting, so it will come up again in about another three weeks if people are interested in that grace is there, so.

95
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.880
Sally MacFarlane: yeah okay.

96
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.190
Sally MacFarlane: um.

97
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.770
Sally MacFarlane: And then the open forum, we talked about having a week and.

98
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.770
Sally MacFarlane: Non recorded on discord chat has has that happened in your time zone done.

99
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.500
Danno Ferrin: i'm not yet I haven't heard the time it's happening, and this was a bad week for it to happen, because everyone was that uh.

100
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.820
Danno Ferrin: yeah i'm.

101
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.630
Danno Ferrin: The answer down at the dead connect yeah.

102
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.190
Sally MacFarlane: Okay.

103
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:37.650
Sally MacFarlane: yeah we haven't we haven't had this Thompson yet either, and I think it's a good idea, just seems like this short and volunteers to actually make it happen.

104
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:43.950
Danno Ferrin: yeah every everything I propose is like Oh, we got from that Oh, we got this other meeting, then.

105
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.020
Sally MacFarlane: Suddenly you're right.

106
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.490
Danno Ferrin: My proposals have gone on dry.

107
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:56.370
yeah.

108
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.380
Sally MacFarlane: deprecating love for Jay.

109
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.140
Sally MacFarlane: I think the sticking point that was the DJ company X, no.

110
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.480
Sally MacFarlane: way around that.

111
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:11.790
Danno Ferrin: um.

112
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:19.230
Danno Ferrin: No, we haven't I think if resolvable, but I think it's something Vigo need to push it on it's not important enough to me to carry it out.

113
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.760
Sally MacFarlane: yeah.

114
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:33.270
Sally MacFarlane: And in good news, the looks to me analysis is now working.

115
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.990
Sally MacFarlane: So I think there was some helpful input for me to get that I will say.

116
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.970
Sally MacFarlane: Thank you.

117
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.070
Sally MacFarlane: Anything else a want to cover.

118
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.310
Hart Montgomery: Can hijack this to ask a question.

119
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.660
sure.

120
00:14:54.540 --> 00:15:03.570
Hart Montgomery: So we're putting together the global forum program committee right now we are short on basic people.

121
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:12.780
Hart Montgomery: Would either of you be interested or would you all recommend anyone who would be interested and being on the global forum.

122
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.350
Hart Montgomery: PC who's familiar with based.

123
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.980
Danno Ferrin: programs many yep.

124
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.070
Sally MacFarlane: what's involved in.

125
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.670
Doing.

126
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:30.120
Hart Montgomery: Review talks and probably a couple meetings to discuss.

127
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.630
Hart Montgomery: What to accept.

128
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:38.670
Hart Montgomery: So I would say, probably were estimating about.

129
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:46.050
Hart Montgomery: five to six hours total of reviewing proposals and then maybe two hours of meetings.

130
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.500
Sally MacFarlane: When do you need to know.

131
00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.040
Hart Montgomery: Sometimes we would be ideal.

132
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.520
Sally MacFarlane: Well yeah I can think about it, give a T.

133
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.740
Sally MacFarlane: shirt do you need one person to like is one person enough.

134
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.480
Hart Montgomery: A one or two would be good.

135
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:26.130
Danno Ferrin: So on yeah we'd be good for the technicals I don't know how.

136
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.450
Danno Ferrin: You know if you need business people as well or not.

137
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:42.540
Hart Montgomery: um yeah it's probably That would be good, but we may be able to get those I think that that's an easier thing to get in sort of the.

138
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:53.550
Hart Montgomery: The business focus talks are sort of easier for people who aren't as familiar with the project to analyze.

139
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:56.520
Hart Montgomery: If that makes sense.

140
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.130
Hart Montgomery: yeah like.

141
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.170
Hart Montgomery: We.

142
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:08.850
Hart Montgomery: You know, we just need at least one technical basic person who can you know, for lack of a better word called bs.

143
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.330
Hart Montgomery: Basically talks on technical base who talks.

144
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:27.030
Danno Ferrin: i'm I have a project planning meeting tomorrow i'll have a better idea what my availability is over the next month, once we get through that there's a really big hit a feature that they've got me critical path on and it's kind of stressful.

145
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.740
Hart Montgomery: You say what it is.

146
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.730
Danno Ferrin: yeah actually it's a hip for 10.

147
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.960
Danno Ferrin: we're embedding a theory of transactions inside of a darragh.

148
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.730
Danno Ferrin: To enable consumer wallets to be able to post it there are so.

149
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.170
Hart Montgomery: cool.

150
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.740
Danno Ferrin: that's a pretty is public so it's not like i'm hiding anything.

151
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.860
Hart Montgomery: yeah yeah no that's a that's a nice feature.

152
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.050
Hart Montgomery: that'll be a good certainly a strong functionality.

153
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.670
Danno Ferrin: I know.

154
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.690
Danno Ferrin: kind of in light of one of the topics topics that i'm.

155
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:09.720
Danno Ferrin: Jim wants to propose from from firefly on to talk about is there's interoperability and consumer tools and enterprise systems.

156
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:10.800
Hart Montgomery: So.

157
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.210
Danno Ferrin: To get back in.

158
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.240
Hart Montgomery: we're going to have a lot of interoperability talks, but I mean that's seems to be what's in demand.

159
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.510
Hart Montgomery: So that's.

160
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.410
Hart Montgomery: that's probably the hottest area we're seeing right now.

161
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.970
Hart Montgomery: In terms of at least one come across my desk is people are.

162
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:38.010
Hart Montgomery: very concerned with you know, integration and interoperability so.

163
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.670
Danno Ferrin: I don't want access my fabric instance with Meta mask.

164
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.930
Hart Montgomery: yeah nobody wants to write smart contract code twice right.

165
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.210
Danno Ferrin: yeah so.

166
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.240
Danno Ferrin: Might might beat second life borough or some other mdm solution for fabric, who knows we'll see.

167
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.660
Hart Montgomery: No, I well I think borough is.

168
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.140
Hart Montgomery: Gone but.

169
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.900
Danno Ferrin: i'd be totally repurpose.

170
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.400
Hart Montgomery: yeah i'd be curious to see what fabric, would do with like.

171
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.140
Hart Montgomery: I don't know how easy or hard, it would be to.

172
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:20.940
Hart Montgomery: To run an avm and fabric, I mean fabric has made some I consider unfortunate design.

173
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.400
Hart Montgomery: Decisions where there are a lot of things that are not as modular as you would like them.

174
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:33.510
Hart Montgomery: So, like the protocol ends up having hooks all over the place.

175
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.930
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

176
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.750
Hart Montgomery: Like there's a bunch of stuff that you just.

177
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:52.530
Hart Montgomery: You just really don't like to see like they've essentially a hard coded like X 509 functionality all over the place, so if you want to change the signing algorithm or anything like that it's just a nightmare.

178
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.020
Danno Ferrin: sounds like basic.

179
00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:58.560
Danno Ferrin: To be honest.

180
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:11.940
Danno Ferrin: It is a hearing problem if we if we try to put network signatures inside of a theorem it would be a nightmare, because it had to change you can't extract public keys from an Edward signature, we have that mark fields it's a transaction.

181
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.760
Danno Ferrin: Nobody wants to rewrite Meta mask.

182
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.480
Hart Montgomery: or being people are supporting bls signatures in the future right.

183
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:20.850
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

184
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.260
Hart Montgomery: I mean.

185
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.160
Danno Ferrin: But it's gonna be like.

186
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:30.480
Hart Montgomery: yeah that's amazing though right because it's very easy to get if you're running a permission blockchain.

187
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.350
Hart Montgomery: You can use bls signatures and get a signed state of the blockchain right if you threshold eyes.

188
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:44.130
Hart Montgomery: And that's just super useful for so many applications where you have people that need to acquire the blockchain.

189
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.680
Danno Ferrin: yeah so.

190
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.860
Hart Montgomery: I don't know that's always excited me.

191
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:52.380
Hart Montgomery: So.

192
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:53.790
Danno Ferrin: pay close again.

193
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.920
Danno Ferrin: Please see it this week, not next week.

194
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.970
Hart Montgomery: it's this week.

195
00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.110
Hart Montgomery: So, submit a ton of talks like.

196
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.640
Hart Montgomery: The way the Linux foundation likes to do these things is.

197
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.720
Hart Montgomery: For people like yourself there.

198
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.620
Hart Montgomery: They will definitely be interested in having you give a talk.

199
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.930
Hart Montgomery: But they would like some input as to what precise talk you give.

200
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:28.920
Hart Montgomery: And so, if you if you can't decide submit multiple things and they'll say like well, we want to pick this talk from Daniel now this other one.

201
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:30.540
So.

202
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:44.850
Hart Montgomery: it's a really lightweight process it's essentially like to like paragraph blurbs of text so it's lightweight to write it as lightweight to review so.

203
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:54.600
Danno Ferrin: I think I know what I want to talk on though just the things I had to do to get em working well inside of Tara and what i'm working on now will really be the final piece of that.

204
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.180
Danno Ferrin: yeah like integration thing.

205
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:08.700
Hart Montgomery: that's a really good talk and because there are going to be lots of other people who are want to get the vm running inside their block chain and there's a lot to learn for that, so I think that's an excellent.

206
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.110
Hart Montgomery: excellent proposal yeah.

207
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.000
Danno Ferrin: So anyone from Australia.

208
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.560
Danno Ferrin: Ireland.

209
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.220
Hart Montgomery: it's a really lightweight process so.

210
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:44.160
Hart Montgomery: Last year, I think I submitted I like submitted five on Friday, the Friday afternoon, they were do.

211
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.160
Sally MacFarlane: You.

212
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.620
Hart Montgomery: Know started submitted, I submitted a bunch for other people to you can propose people.

213
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.090
Sally MacFarlane: yeah so.

214
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.600
Hart Montgomery: I did.

215
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:00.000
Sally MacFarlane: uh huh.

216
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.600
Sally MacFarlane: where's the information on the actual process.

217
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.340
Hart Montgomery: Great question.

218
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.840
Hart Montgomery: they've splattered it really everywhere online.

219
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:23.400
Hart Montgomery: If you just Google hyper ledger that if you Google hyper ledger global forum you'll find it.

220
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.930
Hart Montgomery: it's not it's here there's the link I just posted in the zoom chat.

221
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.140
So.

222
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.330
Hart Montgomery: it's also going to be.

223
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:50.370
Hart Montgomery: This immediate it's I think immediately following the Member summit and immediately before OSS Europe.

224
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.200
So.

225
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.990
Hart Montgomery: At least for me it's a.

226
00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:01.680
Hart Montgomery: it's a travel once and hit three events so.

227
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.260
Danno Ferrin: what's the Europe Linux what's the other one.

228
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.970
Hart Montgomery: I remember summit.

229
00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.450
Danno Ferrin: Every summer oh yeah that's the day before yeah.

230
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.870
Hart Montgomery: So we used to do those separately but.

231
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.440
Hart Montgomery: it's good to.

232
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.520
Sally MacFarlane: travel.

233
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.790
Hart Montgomery: yeah well we used to have a lot of travel, where they would.

234
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:33.180
Hart Montgomery: Do like two day events and nobody wants to do a long flight for two day events right.

235
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.640
yeah right.

236
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.050
Hart Montgomery: So it's better to lump things together, and you know.

237
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:50.610
Hart Montgomery: You have like two events, a year, people will consider traveling for them, you know if they're like nice four week events, if you have like an event every two months that it's.

238
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.660
Hart Montgomery: Two days it's it's a lot harder to convince people to go.

239
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:59.490
Sally MacFarlane: Especially now, I guess, with the blood.

240
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:10.350
Hart Montgomery: yeah now used to traveling and like people have done virtual conferences so really have to.

241
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.490
Hart Montgomery: You really have to make the hallway track.

242
00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:16.470
Hart Montgomery: Important.

243
00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:27.630
Hart Montgomery: If you want to you know get people to go to conferences, where sort of the you know meeting people and discussing things is the centerpiece rather than.

244
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:34.800
Hart Montgomery: You know, going to the tags this work for us like cactus happened.

245
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.030
Hart Montgomery: Because of some conversations at these conferences.

246
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:40.620
So.

247
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:45.690
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

248
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.180
Sally MacFarlane: Thanks guys anything else.

249
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:53.340
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

250
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:55.500
Sally MacFarlane: wrap it up.

251
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.170
Hart Montgomery: For me so.

252
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.490
Sally MacFarlane: Okay cool recording will be posted.

253
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.260
Sally MacFarlane: Thanks.

254
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.460
Hart Montgomery: Thanks a lot.
