Francesco Andreoli: Do we know It's just didn't. Ah,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.270
Francesco Andreoli: Charlie!

16
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.290
Fabio Di Fabio: Ah, Justin is sick. I think

17
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.560
Fabio Di Fabio: he brought that.

18
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:46.179
Fabio Di Fabio: I think so. So He and the family is six on. Probably

19
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.129
Fabio Di Fabio: it's not working today.

20
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.079
Fabio Di Fabio: See? That is

21
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.849
Fabio Di Fabio: Gary Getty's uh

22
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:10.150
Fabio Di Fabio: propped zero week. Of course I get automatic.

23
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.580
Fabio Di Fabio: It's.

24
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.480
Fabio Di Fabio: I also read the

25
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:21.450
Fabio Di Fabio: I brought something on a biscuit that is not joining. I know he's not going to join you, he said, on this code.

26
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.659
Francesco Andreoli: Oh, yeah, I see the message. Now

27
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.789
Francesco Andreoli: that's good. We can make make a one. Uh,

28
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:35.980
Francesco Andreoli: I would say, sure. But uh, yeah, welcome everybody to the call. Let me just

29
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.349
thank you.

30
00:11:44.840 --> 00:12:12.740
Francesco Andreoli: And if you have any question and ah, I think Ah, general announcement, I put that one year because a couple of weeks ago we there we were the apology global for in Dublin, with Ah, with Matt and keen. Dan was over there. And yeah, I was was a good time. We had also like a boot where we literally I spoke with a bunch of other other ah maintainers, and we also had a good opportunity to fill out different different contact for

31
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:19.850
Francesco Andreoli: for us to to to see who is actually running a enterprise infrastructure.

32
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:37.669
Francesco Andreoli: Um! Let's move, I guess, like merge updates. I don't know, like I have always just seen there. But anybody want to give an update or have anything obviously in diverse happens. But I don't know there may be post-merge. Ah, post-merge work also on the basis side

33
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.150
Francesco Andreoli: we need to know.

34
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:45.509
Fabio Di Fabio: Yeah, I can start then, if anyone else want to add something else soon

35
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.629
Fabio Di Fabio: post-merge. So we did our release

36
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.009
Fabio Di Fabio: on the Fridays last week.

37
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:58.329
Fabio Di Fabio: To address some of the more

38
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.750
Fabio Di Fabio: annoying back. Also there

39
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.690
Fabio Di Fabio: bugs that were reported by

40
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:13.399
Fabio Di Fabio: many, user internally and externally like at the midst of the session timeouts

41
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.380
Fabio Di Fabio: and the empty blocks.

42
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:26.139
Fabio Di Fabio: There probably were also other optimizations related to the performance. For example,

43
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.650
Fabio Di Fabio: I have enough to

44
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:46.339
Fabio Di Fabio: optimized specifically for this kind of machine,

45
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.959
Fabio Di Fabio: And so this went out on Friday, and

46
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:59.039
Fabio Di Fabio: we had some good ah feedback on the

47
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:08.909
Fabio Di Fabio: the reduced number of error for the consensus layer less time out, and

48
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.340
Fabio Di Fabio: also some improvement in the

49
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.750
Fabio Di Fabio: ah

50
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.880
Fabio Di Fabio: at the session that were submitted.

51
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.520
Fabio Di Fabio: Uh, but these, as uh narrower

52
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.960
Fabio Di Fabio: it's

53
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:30.730
Fabio Di Fabio: an error. Let's say, a memory leak. That was Watson after the

54
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:42.150
Fabio Di Fabio: uh that cause the memory leak uh add more um

55
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.479
Fabio Di Fabio: three so more variable, and

56
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.189
Fabio Di Fabio: after, let's say some um,

57
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.909
Fabio Di Fabio: usually as

58
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.809
Fabio Di Fabio: to free the memory, but it was not a

59
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:20.259
Fabio Di Fabio: Of course we do. The memory leak. So after a day we start receiving we

60
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.660
Fabio Di Fabio: report about issue, but by so uh

61
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:31.829
Fabio Di Fabio: was not responsive, and so we identified um

62
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.050
Fabio Di Fabio: this problem

63
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.810
Fabio Di Fabio: on Sunday morning, you of time, and it

64
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.820
Fabio Di Fabio: so the the the fix for that was already a

65
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:08.189
Fabio Di Fabio: problem before, and the the Pr. Was not yet a single the unit test. We were not ready to integrate this in the doctrine.

66
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.760
Fabio Di Fabio: Get her

67
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:24.740
Fabio Di Fabio: during the weekend. The The fix has been finalized, and so we were able to

68
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:33.529
Fabio Di Fabio: verify that the memory leak, the fix for the memory, leak, work it, and the

69
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:53.530
Fabio Di Fabio: Erez agmoni and the best reasons were fine after that. So we started to communicate the user which was the problem and how to mitigate it. Not really a good mitigation, because basically they had to start when they had this problem.

70
00:16:54.260 --> 00:17:01.260
Fabio Di Fabio: And so we started thinking about a not fix that we raised it yesterday. But

71
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:09.750
Fabio Di Fabio: so the dot, for also on the record of many users that were running the snapshot to

72
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:22.589
Fabio Di Fabio: were giving a good feedback on the fix. So we did that. There is also another

73
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.959
Fabio Di Fabio: Small speaks to make the

74
00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:34.249
Fabio Di Fabio: new option that Asian added for high-speed instances

75
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.620
Fabio Di Fabio: to work

76
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:44.189
Fabio Di Fabio: also if this specified in the configuration file, and not only on the command line, so it's very small one,

77
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:57.320
Fabio Di Fabio: and that fix actually has only this two ah fixes, and after the release of dot four this God is much more quiet, and

78
00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.999
Fabio Di Fabio: we are not seeing, say,

79
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:11.969
Fabio Di Fabio: about the that is not responsive. Of course there are still other issue opened

80
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.880
Fabio Di Fabio: more

81
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.849
Fabio Di Fabio: with one hundred percent success like

82
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:37.459
Fabio Di Fabio: before, like other clients, do so. And we need to improve when that part. This is mainly related to the

83
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:46.890
Fabio Di Fabio: blocking for times that when they takes more than very few seconds they could go.

84
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:54.380
Fabio Di Fabio: Course timeouts in the consensus ray. Your client and the consensus are your client.

85
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:13.760
Fabio Di Fabio: And so this is uh something that can cause uh, i'm missing at the session or at the session. That is not the testing there.

86
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.079
Fabio Di Fabio: The the very last ad since the block is taking too much

87
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.490
Fabio Di Fabio: bought themselves.

88
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.979
Fabio Di Fabio: Um, I don't know if I missed something, please. Uh

89
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.940
Fabio Di Fabio: i'm a jury. Please add something if I miss him,

90
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.989
Fabio Di Fabio: that's all. I think.

91
00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:47.789
Francesco Andreoli: Um, The Member League was also on the weekends right a bunch of messages on that.

92
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.990
Fabio Di Fabio: Yes, it was on the weekend,

93
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.209
Fabio Di Fabio: because it's it to appear after one day

94
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.820
Fabio Di Fabio: it it was dependent on the amount of

95
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.959
Fabio Di Fabio: Java. You reserve it to be so. But usually, after one day

96
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.180
Fabio Di Fabio: users started to complain. So yes,

97
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:24.420
Francesco Andreoli: okay, cool. Uh, if there are no other uh updates. Uh, I think Matt was starting the call on a discussion proposal. I don't know. Do we know if there are some, or anybody have an idea? If it is a slash? Where

98
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:35.600
Francesco Andreoli: uh we're maintained? Because I remember, like he pushed um a wiki page. I don't know. Maybe there were some people like having an update on this last week.

99
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.319
Francesco Andreoli: Do not? We just want him for the next time

100
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.990
Francesco Andreoli: a cool um.

101
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.679
Francesco Andreoli: Anybody want to jump on this,

102
00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.100
Francesco Andreoli: You know. We I think, concerned about Kit.

103
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.530
Francesco Andreoli: It obsesses she will race, or with the alternative gitlab.

104
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.269
Francesco Andreoli: That's probably a Matt's topic.

105
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:22.130
Francesco Andreoli: Doesn't look like the next top. It was the Java seventeen migration

106
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:27.330
Francesco Andreoli: that was awesome. That's it all. I think that was a topic also from that.

107
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.740
Then

108
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:45.029
Francesco Andreoli: I think something is building the petition miracle certificate out a bit with within Java. I don't know anybody wrote this, or is still in all the

109
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.179
Francesco Andreoli: an old to be permit

110
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.740
Ameziane Hamlat: Many responsive ever exist.

111
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.150
Ameziane Hamlat: I I I think there are some old um.

112
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:08.979
Ameziane Hamlat: It's not probably all right. Yeah actions and Java Seventeen, for example, are,

113
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:14.079
Ameziane Hamlat: I think they are already discussed last time. Okay, sounds good. Yeah.

114
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:19.370
Ameziane Hamlat: And for the also, I guess. Also the Maintainer's definition.

115
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.429
Ameziane Hamlat: She organized non-code contribution.

116
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:31.909
Francesco Andreoli: Nice. Okay. Cool. So no sounds good. It's definitely like a good point also to uh

117
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:43.780
Francesco Andreoli: make up. And then in terms of Roadmap Review. Optimistic support. Let's keep. I remember, Nicola, you had a

118
00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:48.430
Francesco Andreoli: You had a comment, not for this, for another topic.

119
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.959
Francesco Andreoli: Do you remember what it

120
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.220
Francesco Andreoli: cathedral,

121
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:03.450
Nicolas Massart: just like you check. Yeah, It was perhaps discussion on about hot-fixed release processes.

122
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.960
Francesco Andreoli: It's.

123
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:15.229
Nicolas Massart: Yeah, that's. That's this. You're right, because we had this discussion in the release channel, one on the discord, and because we had some

124
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.620
Nicolas Massart: uh issues agreeing, you know, with each other, Maybe it would be good to

125
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:27.099
Nicolas Massart: yeah fully state what we can do outside of the regular releases.

126
00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.620
Francesco Andreoli: Yes,

127
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:39.130
Nicolas Massart: yeah, Probably because we we need more people to discuss that than myself.

128
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:50.830
Francesco Andreoli: Sounds good. Looks like It's a short one today, any other. I don't know discussion. You want to give the team an update or any extra topics.

129
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.690
Francesco Andreoli: You're one. Oh, there you go go for it.

130
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:14.450
Diego López León: Yeah, I'm: just okay, everybody. I I join a bit later to the to the meeting. But I want to know if there is some plan for the upcoming releases. I mean, if the next one will be of May, or if there is some other code

131
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.510
Diego López León: that fix uh on on queue

132
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.740
Fabio Di Fabio: I

133
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:32.420
Fabio Di Fabio: We yesterday. Actually, we released it from rain because Dot three was released from me and

134
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.179
Fabio Di Fabio: main there were only

135
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:45.360
Fabio Di Fabio: they ought to fix. Basically So we simplified, and the release of the full domain. We don't have any current

136
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.980
Fabio Di Fabio: upfix

137
00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:00.780
Fabio Di Fabio: the chat. I don't see any outfix pending, so I think the next one. We

138
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.690
Fabio Di Fabio: Ah, we be by a scheduled

139
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.810
Diego López León: Okay, awesome. And what's the date? I mean, It's like in two weeks from now.

140
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:19.559
Fabio Di Fabio: Yeah, Usually the the the schedule is. So every two weeks are not wrong. Okay,

141
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.190
