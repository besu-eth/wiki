1
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.780
Gary Schulte: Good morning from here, anyway.

2
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.760
Grace Hartley: hey guys.

3
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.950
Grace Hartley: Yes, i'm not sure what the problem was there, I think it was on the hyper.

4
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.490
Grace Hartley: ledger side.

5
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.750
Francesco Andreoli: here.

6
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.640
Grace Hartley: it's like recordings in progress and we've shared the agenda chat so we can.

7
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.610
Grace Hartley: get started, maybe if.

8
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.260
Grace Hartley: it's really just send a note and say.

9
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.070
Grace Hartley: days a week, is working.

10
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.260
Grace Hartley: out and we can.

11
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.260
Grace Hartley: I will share my screen.

12
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.620
Francesco Andreoli: mode squeeze.

13
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.270
me great Thank you.

14
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:57.270
Grace Hartley: Great housekeeping into just notice, please follow the antitrust policy this meeting is being recorded, please mute all speaking looks like everyone's doing that great and feel free to use the raise hand feature.

15
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:11.550
Grace Hartley: Besides that, so general announcements, it seems, so we have the CIPS program where we need to go ahead and document, our main contributors.

16
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.860
Grace Hartley: It looks like heart just Brian update that there's going to be a.

17
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.700
Grace Hartley: Essentially there's going to be a hyper ledger.

18
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.970
Grace Hartley: Sub organization to handle the grant money because hyper ledger itself isn't set up to handle the grant money so they're finally setting that up it's.

19
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:50.010
Grace Hartley: Taking a little while but it looks like it's making progress there and then the one thing is the main activity log so I just wanted to like someone remain renamed it a.

20
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.850
Grace Hartley: maintainer, or so it looks like.

21
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.560
Grace Hartley: sell the team, it looks like everyone's already kind of filled this out, is there any questions or anything that we need to.

22
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.070
Grace Hartley: or anyone not know what this is or want to include themselves or thinks they need to update this.

23
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.750
Justin Florentine: yeah.

24
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.800
Justin Florentine: This is justin I haven't had a nine year old daughter soon as I can.

25
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.570
Grace Hartley: cool okay great yeah yeah.

26
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.040
Justin Florentine: we'll get through it, it looks like.

27
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.520
Grace Hartley: yeah.

28
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.180
Grace Hartley: If you don't mind that'd be great otherwise looks like.

29
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:41.730
Grace Hartley: More or less if there's anyone who's not on the call or do you think are missing from this please just you know, give them a friendly reminder to.

30
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:52.590
Grace Hartley: fill this out, we just want to make sure that we're just H1 2022 to be clear, so through July 1 just want to make sure that we're giving everyone credit where credit is due.

31
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.710
Grace Hartley: awesome thanks everyone good this is looking really good.

32
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.900
Grace Hartley: And then I will go back questions on that.

33
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:16.410
Grace Hartley: Release updates, so I know the RC one for 2022 dot seven, although was delayed, I know Dino is out, I just see a few questions are we.

34
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.110
Grace Hartley: What is the latest.

35
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.340
Grace Hartley: It looks like it's delayed because of this, have we reschedule this you know, I was, I was looking around but i'm not sure I saw that.

36
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:37.440
Justin Florentine: yeah I think we're aiming for this week I don't think that we've actually put a date down last we talked about it and discord we were thinking this Wednesday so tomorrow.

37
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:51.150
Justin Florentine: I know we have lots of good stuff that's gone in over the last week, so I definitely think we should get something out I wouldn't mind doing one today just so we have an official release that has the support Leah settings baked into it.

38
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.200
Justin Florentine: But you know if that's too much of a rush to miles fine to supposed to supposed to merge is tomorrow.

39
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.530
Daniel Lehrner: So somebody somebody wrote on, I think it was discouraged that she will do it.

40
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.720
Daniel Lehrner: So her Wednesday so in a few hours or something like this.

41
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.950
Grace Hartley: yeah it will take this evening.

42
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.740
Grace Hartley: This evening, oh sorry.

43
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.810
yep.

44
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.240
Justin Florentine: That should be fine great.

45
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.750
Grace Hartley: Great great great okay.

46
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.440
Grace Hartley: Next up.

47
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.260
Grace Hartley: i'm not sure, but this one, but.

48
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.070
Daniel Lehrner: I put this I can I can get some context.

49
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.210
Grace Hartley: For me, we have some tests from the from the FDA or call them have tests.

50
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.380
Daniel Lehrner: And one of them, in the end is testing if all the clients are compatible on certain API calls.

51
00:05:50.580 --> 00:06:08.850
Daniel Lehrner: And for one of the tests we are failing because we for transaction be returned to extra fields, so they they are not part of the spec so the one is public key and the other one is raw which is like they are being called a transaction.

52
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.390
Daniel Lehrner: There was some discussion on the far end this card.

53
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:26.310
Daniel Lehrner: So I can maybe summarize, so there was light client the creator of the test in the end, she was in favor of only returning fields that are in the spec.

54
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:34.350
Daniel Lehrner: This argument was that the client should be or whoever runs the client should be able to treat it as a black box.

55
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:50.550
Daniel Lehrner: So whenever I want to switch out the client I should not need to care which client support which fields and if everybody's following respect it's the case if some clients have some extra fields and others not I cannot do that anymore.

56
00:06:52.710 --> 00:07:02.610
Daniel Lehrner: Then the know because he cannot join today he shared also his thoughts and his thoughts were that we should be able to have extra fields.

57
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:26.340
Daniel Lehrner: As arguments word that the spec should not be always too soon for the spec to be frozen, so the client teams should have opportunity to make some improvement to make some experiments whatever and that in the end the test should ignore the extra fields.

58
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.390
Daniel Lehrner: His proposal was that it could add.

59
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:40.680
Daniel Lehrner: To life like or a configuration fleck to India and activate like a strict mode, so if we do this, then we only do what the success.

60
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.690
Daniel Lehrner: survive I edit this today to the corpus again, so we have to.

61
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:54.540
Daniel Lehrner: To opinions to the Indian so far, well, it, so I wanted to ask the other way of thinking which direction we should go.

62
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.930
Karim T.: just looking at.

63
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:12.330
Karim T.: The could seem that we are using subject legs at this object contains of fields, so when we are selling things is object, we have this sheet prisons, but i'm not sure we are really using this field but.

64
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:13.710
Daniel Lehrner: yeah.

65
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:25.830
Daniel Lehrner: I mean, so the two I don't know that the two options, I see Cindy and vote for dinner set so we keep the default, as it is right now, and afterwards we have like.

66
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:37.620
Daniel Lehrner: A config option to go to the to the spec to the to the strict spec i'm just not sure thinking about it last night i'm not sure if this makes sense because would.

67
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:50.580
Daniel Lehrner: anybody really use this option to take things away just to follow the spec so I don't know the other way would be we change the default to only follow the spec.

68
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.880
Daniel Lehrner: And we have a config option to add these two fields again for whoever needs them.

69
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:06.840
Karim T.: We are doing lc lc topic breaking Chung so maybe you engine removes this field and to say, if you still want.

70
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.310
Karim T.: To see you can use.

71
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.280
Karim T.: The new flag on new option.

72
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.970
Justin Florentine: yeah I think I disagree with white clients on this one.

73
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:32.310
Justin Florentine: I think you can still treat the client as a black box, you can, if it has extra fields in it like that's one of the big advantages of json and it allows you to do you know migratory path without breaking things if you need to update your API.

74
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.330
Justin Florentine: Right so like you could roll out additional field.

75
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:50.010
Justin Florentine: that people could slowly start adopting and then you walk into the spec later like if you don't have a way to do that, then everybody has to be lockstep in their upgrade path I don't really think that's warranted for the rpc is the way it is for the blockchain.

76
00:09:52.620 --> 00:10:08.130
Justin Florentine: So I mean, as far as like what do we do now to get us to the tests yeah I think I agree with what Kareem suggested and just get rid of those fields for now documented in the irc and maybe add them back in if people really are upset about it.

77
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.370
Justin Florentine: But I don't know I might.

78
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:19.440
Justin Florentine: I might start a broader discussion with this on our end because I don't I don't know that I really like this is the architectural direction anybody else.

79
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:32.670
Gary Schulte: I think the spec has been loose in the past and there's something there's something to be said about having a spec that you can follow and there's not gonna be surprises, if you want to swap clients out.

80
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:42.570
Gary Schulte: especially considering this is now execution clients are are now more modular and part of a part of a spec that's not monoliths anymore.

81
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.780
Gary Schulte: I kind of agree with like client that I think that we should have a spec and stick with it, especially if it's going to be relied upon.

82
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:58.140
Gary Schulte: By consensus clients, I mean how many how many weird change things that we dealt with dealing with a web sockets and numbers because it's one of the few.

83
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:06.870
Gary Schulte: Consensus clients that are using web sockets I think that there's there's value in conformity and in this particular case because of how.

84
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.400
Gary Schulte: Basically, you know execution clients are now becoming more modular I think that they're going to be more like legos in the future.

85
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:25.650
Justin Florentine: yeah I think so, too, like i'm not actually arguing against the idea of spec i'm just saying that like if there are fields that are returned that are not in the spec that should not be considered a test.

86
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:27.900
Justin Florentine: Like I think I think.

87
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.680
Justin Florentine: That that's the.

88
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.960
Justin Florentine: json right it's free for them to just very, very like we're not using json schemas.

89
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.340
Justin Florentine: If we are then, then I would I would retract retract my argument.

90
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.760
Gary Schulte: Right.

91
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.270
Justin Florentine: I think.

92
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:53.160
Gary Schulte: I think we do have json the rpc there has been an effort over the last year to take the rpc the rpc spec and put it into json schema there, I believe there is actually a repo that's json schema for it.

93
00:11:53.850 --> 00:12:00.000
Justin Florentine: So, then, I would say we should defer the tests that are effectively asking for that until that's widely adopted.

94
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:07.020
Justin Florentine: Back to me seems like the right way to do this if you want to have tightly defined API responses use the schema for it.

95
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.100
yeah.

96
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:17.280
Justin Florentine: And then I guess we'll just have to introduce API version, and when we want to make changes which is sucks.

97
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:28.350
Gary Schulte: yeah I think that what what is what's unfortunate is you know there's going to be based to users out there, private networks and so forth, that are going to have they're going to be relying on these fields is just a given.

98
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:35.190
Gary Schulte: That if it's there somebody's going to be using it, and how are we going to communicate this change out effectively.

99
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:44.370
Gary Schulte: yeah it's probably probably a tempest in a teapot but i'm i'm on board with what Kareem said, where we have as soon as we kind of have someone come out of the woodwork who says.

100
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:55.980
Gary Schulte: hey these fields used to be here what happened to them, we can at least say you know we are conforming to spec and you can use this flag to use the prior format for the fields that you might have been relying on.

101
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.240
Gary Schulte: I.

102
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.250
Justin Florentine: worried that that's going to be a lot of work.

103
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:08.280
Justin Florentine: it's, the only thing like going everywhere and adding all these flags to check whether or not something is enabled I think it could warrant a refactoring.

104
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.780
Justin Florentine: You know, like or mime type support right, you can throw it on my type that says hey.

105
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:24.150
Justin Florentine: conforms to spec or doesn't and then I would hope that vertex has some sort of you know serialization plugin system where you can plug in a different spec and it'll use different serialized there's to produce.

106
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:44.850
Justin Florentine: Your output, based on that mind type or whatever it is, but what what i'm worried about is that the value that we get out of this is much less than the cost, it takes of going through all of our api's and wrapping flags around all the additional pieces of information that our users.

107
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:53.610
Gary Schulte: yeah I think these are there's only a couple ones that were identified now but yeah I think there could be a minefield of things that.

108
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.020
Gary Schulte: You know.

109
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.550
Gary Schulte: we're slightly out of spec on.

110
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:09.540
Justin Florentine: So maybe step one is to actually figure out how bad, it is, and if it's less than like a dozen things don't worry about it, but if it's you know 50 things, then we might have to push back or do some refactoring to accommodate it.

111
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.300
Gary Schulte: yeah agreed.

112
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.050
Grace Hartley: So who can own the investigation.

113
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.250
Grace Hartley: You know how much how big of an impact is this.

114
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.710
Justin Florentine: I can, I can own it, but I can't commit to any type of timeline just yet.

115
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.360
Justin Florentine: My own I mean it doesn't seem like it's urgent.

116
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.300
Grace Hartley: it's important but not urgent it's just.

117
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.060
Grace Hartley: I think.

118
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:56.970
Grace Hartley: Does that sound about right like we want to get this right, we want to be able to understand the impact, but it's not like this is a change happening in the next week or two.

119
00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:06.150
Karim T.: But if we just if we want to use FC to do this modification, we need to wait too much.

120
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:08.460
Gary Schulte: True.

121
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.640
Grace Hartley: As part of my ignorance, there is there and it does have to be done before the merge.

122
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.490
Gary Schulte: mean this isn't really.

123
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.760
Justin Florentine: that's the that's the short term fix right.

124
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:33.390
Gary Schulte: These are different tests, though these are rpc compatibility tests which aren't the engine API tests so right, I mean, do we really have to pass these for the merge I don't i'm not hurting anybody say we do.

125
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.520
Justin Florentine: Oh okay that's fair.

126
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:37.260
Grace Hartley: yeah.

127
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:49.170
Justin Florentine: yeah so that's a good that's a good point right so in the past in the recent past there's been an expectation that all clients pass all hype tests, but this is newly introduced, so we need to get clarity on that.

128
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.650
Gary Schulte: But what was your take on that Daniel did in the conversations that you had.

129
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.380
Gary Schulte: Was it with anybody specified in these.

130
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:09.570
Daniel Lehrner: High I don't think it's important for the much Indian is more general discussion, you know because Indian texture fields, they don't hurt and so.

131
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.250
Daniel Lehrner: If it takes longer for us that's that's okay.

132
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:20.130
Daniel Lehrner: Like lauren said he wanted to be just kept up to date so we're going to decide.

133
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.300
Daniel Lehrner: The.

134
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.260
Daniel Lehrner: temperature.

135
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:44.430
Grace Hartley: Great Okay, so I think that's helpful to know timeline it's you know this isn't before the merge Francesco if you don't mind, just like noting that and then also noting that justin will be on point to to own the follow up on it, but we're not expecting to.

136
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:51.180
Grace Hartley: update the fields or anything pre merge unless we have our pleasantly surprised.

137
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.800
Grace Hartley: But it's not urgent that sense that'd be great.

138
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.870
Grace Hartley: Any other comments on this is.

139
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:13.050
Grace Hartley: cool Okay, I think that was a very productive conversation i'm in this check.

140
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.180
Grace Hartley: yeah this.

141
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:24.420
Daniel Lehrner: is also me um So can I can give some context there, so when you run between the cluster in the end.

142
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:44.160
Daniel Lehrner: I mean you don't check the logs by hand to see if your note is up and running and healthy or not, but you rely on some automatic system and for doing this we have to API endpoints one is called lifeless the other one is called readiness.

143
00:17:45.930 --> 00:18:02.580
Daniel Lehrner: So the readiness is OK, as we have it, the readiness, is in the end, I want to know when the notice ready to receive a request, in our case that's like when we are within two blocks or 40 perceive is the chain head because means we are synced so that's okay.

144
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:11.760
Daniel Lehrner: The likeness is meant to be checked regularly, and this should indicate me when the node has a problem that needs to restart.

145
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:20.400
Daniel Lehrner: This happened, for example, last week, when we had this concurrency issue with bonsai.

146
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:36.900
Daniel Lehrner: Somebody was running based so in a cluster and then the note got stuck but the lightness and points that everything is all white and the reason for that is that our likeness and pointers of stuff so it always says everything is alright.

147
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:48.990
Daniel Lehrner: So the question for me is now do we want to do something more, we want to implement the proper one until the more.

148
00:18:50.070 --> 00:19:01.770
Daniel Lehrner: it's also not very easy to save what is lightness in our case, so when does the know really need a restart or when do we know a restart will really help you know.

149
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.830
Daniel Lehrner: I don't know if anybody needs more context than this.

150
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:17.490
Gary Schulte: i've always used readiness like an accumulated context as just this Notice up and able to serve rpc traffic.

151
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:25.260
Gary Schulte: Maybe it wouldn't wouldn't reading this be a better that are important to us when we are stuck would have been better than.

152
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:35.070
Daniel Lehrner: Then yeah I mean I I included this definition of lightness readiness, how is defined by rhetoric and at least they are the definition is.

153
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:47.520
Daniel Lehrner: readiness only when I started out, so I carried on in the beginning, then wants to know tells me is ready, I don't worry this one anymore, so this point, I would license.

154
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:58.350
Daniel Lehrner: So many something we can do that is just not how normally how we use the endpoint at least by by this definition.

155
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.610
Daniel Lehrner: of us, there was a comment from from Adrian.

156
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:18.900
Daniel Lehrner: So he said in his experience lightness should only do the lifeless should only respond okay whenever you call it.

157
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:26.190
Daniel Lehrner: As a that's not what it says, for example, into the definition that distant beretta.

158
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:37.890
Daniel Lehrner: buddy I mean the decision can also be in our case, to believe it like this, we say Okay, if you want to know noticed kelsey refer to reading.

159
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.800
Gary Schulte: I think the.

160
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:52.020
Gary Schulte: Like if we're not live or we need a restart or something to that effect, I mean it's kind of a difficult call to make isn't it that we're in a state that we can't recover from.

161
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:59.970
Daniel Lehrner: yeah I mean that's the source of the thing I mean this this node so normally use more phone number that to.

162
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.780
Daniel Lehrner: My database connection fails, then i'm of life and.

163
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.640
Daniel Lehrner: In our case i'm business case I mean it's very different because when.

164
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:20.730
Daniel Lehrner: I don't know to really realize that we're stuck This is very hard, because I don't know if we would have a database, corruption or something that just restarted would not even help.

165
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:28.500
Daniel Lehrner: Because you need to fix the database, I mean that's the that's The other thing if really this endpoint makes sense.

166
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.340
Daniel Lehrner: But if he decided to not make sense, then maybe we remove it, and we just say okay here is readiness.

167
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:44.400
Daniel Lehrner: Because, if not is confusing for people who are used to, or I mean a normal user expects that that the endpoints.

168
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.000
Daniel Lehrner: signal to them in something is wrong.

169
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:58.080
Gary Schulte: i've yet.

170
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.460
Gary Schulte: i'm probably in the mind if i'm in the minority on this or not, but.

171
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.990
Gary Schulte: The eventual consistency.

172
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.320
Gary Schulte: platforms like Cooper 90s, I.

173
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:21.210
Gary Schulte: Personally don't really think the blockchain clients belong in that space so it's kind of hard to make a call about lightness readiness because you've got a complicated.

174
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:30.000
Gary Schulte: life cycle you're trying to manage with too dumb endpoints it just I don't know a.

175
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.240
Gary Schulte: competitor companies doesn't really seem like a Greek.

176
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:42.660
Justin Florentine: yeah it's one of those situations where we're using docker containers but we're not really using docker ecosystems and terminology and.

177
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:58.530
Justin Florentine: tooling and all that other stuff that sits on top of that, I think I think i'm on your side Gary and Adrian side, where I would say liveliness is like Okay, you can make a socket connection and get some sort of response and readiness might be like the chain head is progressing.

178
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.100
Justin Florentine: I don't know.

179
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:10.110
Justin Florentine: None of none of those are going to none of those are going to tell you like, yes I restart would fix this yeah.

180
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:22.050
Gary Schulte: And that's all it all, I mean I don't know what other what other container systems red hat's special special flavor of communities or whatever, but I mean I think all i've ever seen as they can just restart it that's.

181
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.580
Gary Schulte: Generally, all all all it can really happen, it seems, it seems like it's.

182
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.570
Gary Schulte: It would be difficult.

183
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.060
Gary Schulte: To programmatically give a strong signal.

184
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.940
Justin Florentine: That we should or should not right.

185
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.900
Justin Florentine: Operating and pods like a microservices like a micro service will have a pod that has lots of different containers that are all.

186
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.730
Justin Florentine: a cohesive unit that operate together, and you can do more sophisticated you know stuff with.

187
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.500
Gary Schulte: yeah load balancing or.

188
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:47.100
Whatever.

189
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:51.150
Gary Schulte: If you're I would probably.

190
00:23:53.160 --> 00:24:08.730
Daniel Lehrner: I mean just this all sorts of the product from from codified you're running some sticking service so they're they're running a lot of facilitators and and, of course, they want to know if all of this validation because in the end, do lose money if that's the case and.

191
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:20.790
Daniel Lehrner: So I mean there, I mean I see I see definitely they use case it's just I also would not know how to have a proper likeness chuck know what.

192
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.070
Justin Florentine: I think we're conflating self healing with monitoring honestly I think what they really want is monitoring.

193
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.730
Justin Florentine: If they want self healing that's not something we can do.

194
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.690
Gary Schulte: yeah then angry.

195
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:53.070
Daniel Lehrner: At least I mean what what I would do is maybe to just make it clear in the documentation the blackness will always respond Okay, so you cannot.

196
00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:02.580
Daniel Lehrner: You cannot rely on it to this slide if you want to restart the note on it just to just to make it clear what point is for.

197
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:19.860
Gary Schulte: seems reasonable and maybe maybe we can push back to codify and say is you know what What would you what would you define as lightness and if they have a great definition for life, and so we can consider implementing it, but.

198
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:21.870
Gary Schulte: again.

199
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.200
Justin Florentine: Helen or matt problem, maybe they can help.

200
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.420
Grace Hartley: So it sounds like this.

201
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:49.260
Grace Hartley: I think this issue, I should do we want to close it do we want to keep it open, but obviously we're not going to resolve it, we can go back to.

202
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:55.140
Grace Hartley: Some consensus stakeholders to be clear to this audience who run.

203
00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:03.900
Grace Hartley: staking to get their feedback but it's probably, but at this point, you know we're kind of.

204
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:10.890
Grace Hartley: For Francesco is point with the notes, you know I think blindness is not quite the right way and we want to be defining.

205
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.260
Grace Hartley: Our checks, but we can follow up.

206
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.370
Grace Hartley: On the consensus, it was a few internal teams.

207
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:29.760
Gary Schulte: I think we could at least close this with a documentation action like if if our decision is to keep things as they are, we should at least be like Daniel said, be clear about what the behavior is and not to expect too much from lightness.

208
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:35.400
Gary Schulte: Not to expect to nuanced of a of an endpoint for that.

209
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.980
Grace Hartley: Okay.

210
00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.470
Grace Hartley: That sounds reasonable to me.

211
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.230
Grace Hartley: Daniel can you on that action to.

212
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:49.680
Grace Hartley: Closing and and that update.

213
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.620
Daniel Lehrner: To the.

214
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.240
Show.

215
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.130
Grace Hartley: Thank you.

216
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:59.520
Grace Hartley: Right.

217
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:08.970
Grace Hartley: Along if there's any nothing else on those just looks like broader merge update justin you want to take this.

218
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:17.310
Justin Florentine: sure when last we spoke let's see, I think we were getting ready to do mean that shadow work seven and robson.

219
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:24.990
Justin Florentine: should have worked seven did not go so great, we experienced our and I wrote this up and i'm pretty sure I posted somewhere i'll post it again.

220
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:37.830
Justin Florentine: But I wrote up a detailed explanation, what happened and why it was such a catastrophe, it was the state route mismatch that we run into before on as a known issue and it had been exacerbated and the.

221
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:48.450
Justin Florentine: way that the symptoms presented to us, Dr speak was much more pronounced and quick and happened right around the transition to proof of stake.

222
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:55.620
Justin Florentine: The good news is is that was because we had been making progress on it and we figured out how to make the problem worse, so we could observe it.

223
00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:07.860
Justin Florentine: And since then we think we have found the root cause and a fixed for that has been merged yesterday shout out to cream, he was really burning the candle at both ends working really hard on that one.

224
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:19.140
Justin Florentine: The whole team really worked really hard on that, but really appreciate that it was that was frankly guys that was kind of like a worst case scenario for me that's the kind of thing I have nightmares about this like really subtle.

225
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:27.930
Justin Florentine: Really subtle concurrency issue there that you can't reproduce so the fact that we eventually found it and, and we think we fixed it.

226
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.630
Justin Florentine: is something we should all be proud of, frankly that's that's a really big really big accomplishment.

227
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:45.300
Justin Florentine: I wouldn't mind, maybe sitting down once we have some distance on this and that we have seen that we're confident that this works, maybe doing a post mortem on how we work, the issue.

228
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:51.690
Justin Florentine: So, if something like this does happen again we've kind of have a playbook of things to analyze data to add.

229
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.060
Justin Florentine: Where to look logging statements that were added kind of.

230
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.300
Justin Florentine: Just just sort of have a rubric that's ready for analyzing those issues.

231
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.390
Justin Florentine: So anyway back to the merge.

232
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:14.250
Justin Florentine: Management 48 happened, I think, was last night, maybe this morning i'm not sure we did great on that.

233
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:30.450
Justin Florentine: Everything proceeded past it everything kept up with the chain, we were running a mix of both bonds I and forest nodes this time to try and diagnose this this issue, it has not presented yet i'm keeping an eye on them, but so far, so good.

234
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:39.870
Justin Florentine: We are proposing bad blocks so that's something that we need to take a look at it does seem to be the forest nodes, which is very unexpected.

235
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.700
Justin Florentine: So this is not something that would hurt the network, it would not.

236
00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.060
Justin Florentine: might cause people to propose bad.

237
00:29:50.280 --> 00:30:02.400
Justin Florentine: Gary to answer your question, at least as fork mine has reported them as bad blocks, so we need to kind of look into that and figure out what's what's going on there, but the network is still progressing we're not causing any problems on the network.

238
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:08.250
Justin Florentine: Support Leah slowly that's happening next like tomorrow.

239
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.980
Justin Florentine: So that would be.

240
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:28.770
Justin Florentine: i'm not sure what time here and there's a few the bordello wtf you can see an estimate on where hash power is on the network and when it's going to supposedly tip us over to tdd and switch over to proof of stake so that's The next thing for us to keep an eye on.

241
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:36.480
Justin Florentine: But overall, I mean i'm feeling pretty confident about our merge readiness, we still have.

242
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:50.130
Justin Florentine: Some bugs to fix here and there, but nothing major nothing, nothing life threatening and the progress that we made on the State route mismatch was pretty pretty awesome, so I think that's where we're after the merge what kind of questions can I answer.

243
00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:04.560
Justin Florentine: hype tester thing that we're still working on, as far as being merged related specifically with regard to the engine APIs those are plotting along we're making good progress on those.

244
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.230
Justin Florentine: Like again I don't think i'm forgetting anything now.

245
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:17.250
Gary Schulte: I think, with a couple of PRS from Daniel and Fabio once those emerged, I think the basic will probably be passing.

246
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.120
Gary Schulte: More tests than any other execution client.

247
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:29.430
Justin Florentine: Well, I hope so, because arrogance talking smack on Twitter how they've got the most test pass so let's go down.

248
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.680
Gary Schulte: When they were 18 last I saw what are they now.

249
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.390
Now.

250
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:49.260
Daniel Lehrner: yeah so right now the current status of the PR, including the PR today I open, today we are down to 17 failing.

251
00:31:51.180 --> 00:32:03.570
Daniel Lehrner: There are 15 that are like or related which five years working on, I think he said he made good progress, and then there are two more related, which I know i'm working on.

252
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.750
Daniel Lehrner: But here we are, we are quite close with with maybe having all of them.

253
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.360
Fabio Di Fabio: I can also give an update so for the invalid, the.

254
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.010
Fabio Di Fabio: Change.

255
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:28.620
Fabio Di Fabio: Now there are at least 13 a sync with the last PR and working.

256
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:33.810
Fabio Di Fabio: On the last two that need some more.

257
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.460
Fabio Di Fabio: work.

258
00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:41.970
Daniel Lehrner: Okay, then what will be down to just for failing tests actually.

259
00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:46.770
Justin Florentine: wow.

260
00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:56.490
Gary Schulte: I just checked in the lowest of any fails right now is 18.

261
00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:03.150
Daniel Lehrner: yeah I think Aragon divert 16 but not advocating so they have some regression.

262
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.620
Fabio Di Fabio: yeah i'm a whole so.

263
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.370
Fabio Di Fabio: Say opening.

264
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:40.890
Fabio Di Fabio: issue on it, because some of our tests are flaky and they pass, but sometimes they will not start, I think, because the test we try to read something before best who is ready so i'm hoping, an issue, and so they can provide that solution.

265
00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.940
Grace Hartley: So just to equal it just sounds like we're.

266
00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.160
Grace Hartley: seeing how tomorrow goes no action oh.

267
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.890
Grace Hartley: You know the release tonight will with that sally's ronnie will.

268
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:14.940
Grace Hartley: feed into it, but no action at this point um one question that I realized I fell off of this which maybe.

269
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.620
Grace Hartley: don't know why.

270
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.030
Grace Hartley: Because when you guys were talking about Aragon, having.

271
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.730
Grace Hartley: Because what was it the least number of fixing sorry.

272
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.440
Justin Florentine: me some bros here.

273
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:38.040
Gary Schulte: yeah the the engine engine API five test suite there's 114 tests and no clients are passing them all so it's a race to the bottom.

274
00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:43.050
Grace Hartley: Oh that's exciting okay well if we do, please let me know if you will.

275
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:49.290
Grace Hartley: tweet that out everywhere, but the other thing I know we were kind of competing on was the.

276
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:58.740
Grace Hartley: Like a PDF but we were trying to get done before the merge was a security on it and I don't see that on here and just wanted to follow up on.

277
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.050
Grace Hartley: The progress there I know it's been ongoing the last few weeks with to vora but i'm not sure if it's completed just yet.

278
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:18.300
Gary Schulte: i've seen some updates, but I also saw that one of the primary.

279
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:30.360
Gary Schulte: You know the leads on it was on vacation so it's not surprising that I haven't seen any updates lately honestly i've been focused on the merge, but I have seen some some progress and some action activity on that front.

280
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:36.000
Grace Hartley: When is it Andy they're supposed to end if you don't mind me asking.

281
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.760
Gary Schulte: i've got to look give me just a minute.

282
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.220
Grace Hartley: yeah no worries hey I just want to make sure we're.

283
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:48.510
Grace Hartley: ready if they provide make sense, people are at office you know what June early July, but just want to make sure.

284
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.730
Grace Hartley: If there is anything at the end or just kind of making sure the end date lines up with our work to.

285
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:11.040
Gary Schulte: yeah i've got to do the authentication dance and so forth, so it'll take me a little bit to do that, I can I can circle back on in a minute when I have some detail.

286
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:16.830
Grace Hartley: yeah no worries sounds good yeah I just realized that fell off um any other merge updates or.

287
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.050
comments.

288
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.130
Justin Florentine: I think that's it next steps, polio and i'm really.

289
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.660
Grace Hartley: exciting yeah.

290
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.700
Grace Hartley: great work guys.

291
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:47.040
Grace Hartley: cool insights we'll just do it, we have a little time and I feel like we've skipped it a few times over, will do just a quick run if anything seems particularly exciting or different let's do the last six months, see if there's any.

292
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:53.910
Grace Hartley: We are computing transfer you're proud just kidding because we're not doing this today looks like it's not working okay.

293
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.030
Grace Hartley: I want alright nevermind.

294
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.420
Gary Schulte: managed to pull up the most recent.

295
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:01.890
To.

296
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:12.840
Gary Schulte: punish penetration testing status and the target completion date is the 13th of July.

297
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:25.500
Gary Schulte: Evidence review and documentation will begin on the 14th of July and run till August 8 and deliverables do on August 9 okay okay that's good to know.

298
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:30.000
Grace Hartley: Do you need any help with that Gary or anything from the team to just make sure we're.

299
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.970
Gary Schulte: Going kind of been running on site I.

300
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:42.510
Gary Schulte: Think yeah that's uh I haven't other than the email updates i've been seeing infrequently I haven't really engaged with it terribly much i've been.

301
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.360
Gary Schulte: interested to see what the results are.

302
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:50.820
Grace Hartley: Okay um so when they will just be sure whenever they do share their.

303
00:37:50.820 --> 00:38:03.390
Grace Hartley: results, obviously we you know we'll review as a base new team first but feel free to share with the broader group to or you know feel free to lean on us if you need help because it's a crazy month ahead.

304
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.740
Grace Hartley: But it's exciting that it's done.

305
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.930
Grace Hartley: And the next couple weeks.

306
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:20.250
Grace Hartley: cool roadmap, so I know we talked about the optimistic support last time with matt and I we kind of decided it wasn't.

307
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:25.350
Grace Hartley: super important but a post words conversation or it's important but not urgent.

308
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:33.150
Grace Hartley: And I think it was similar with the period and frequent note operations improvement I don't think there's anything else to add there, we can look the roadmap really quickly, though.

309
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:48.570
Grace Hartley: It looks like this is that last update June 7 so it might be a little out of date, which is 27 here we can see everything that's going on the orange and then, yes, we said optimistically we kind of discussed further out.

310
00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:00.240
Grace Hartley: And then maybe the last thing if anyone, no one has any questions or comments on the roadmap updates.

311
00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.590
Grace Hartley: Give me a chance to speak cool.

312
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:18.270
Grace Hartley: open forum, so it looks like we have the chitchat invite out every week after the contribute call so feel free to jump in there as well, and chat with friends or ask questions.

313
00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.210
Grace Hartley: Anything else the group wants to talk about.

314
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.940
Grace Hartley: cool okay well.

315
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:36.090
Grace Hartley: oops go ahead.

316
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:41.250
Nicolas Massart: No just just wanted to provide an update on the small.

317
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:51.450
Nicolas Massart: discussion I had about the documentation and it was in the previous contribute to a coup in.

318
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.480
Nicolas Massart: Seventh of June.

319
00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:56.310
Nicolas Massart: and

320
00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:10.350
Nicolas Massart: The idea of moving to using good discussion in addition to to discuss on things like that so sadly, we have no consensus yet.

321
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.630
Nicolas Massart: I don't really see a good reason to move forward with this.

322
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:33.450
Nicolas Massart: was not a clear that some good arguments in both ways, but nothing very clear about the decision to make so I like to to lead that trust of it, and I will, I will not move forward on this, for the moment.

323
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:54.330
Nicolas Massart: second thing is that consensus sponsored the end kellogg's material theme which is to use for for the duck and the guy who is doing this is very nice and doing a great job and.

324
00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:13.740
Nicolas Massart: Sadly, because it's sponsored by consensus on the consensus github organization, we can't use this for hyper ledger because hey brother Joseph the different organizations, so I like to raise the question of.

325
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:35.340
Nicolas Massart: Having the sponsorship from the hyper ledger foundation to this project to it's something like hundred dollars per month it's less than what we pay for the bus man subscription that we barely use so maybe this would be a nice thing to do.

326
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:43.470
Nicolas Massart: I guess I can check back with right I don't know who's the best person in a child to check that.

327
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:55.380
Grace Hartley: show that last bit again NICO you're asking you want to reach out to someone bro just want to clarify that last one.

328
00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:15.510
Nicolas Massart: yeah, just to clarify how we can sponsor from the hyper ledger organization on github on a project, so I don't know the only person I have in mind is right, but I like to make sure if he's the right person for that.

329
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:21.540
Grace Hartley: Probably um, but you can email Community architects at hyper ledger.org.

330
00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:28.440
Grace Hartley: And right now has at least one other team member that so they're the right team to help you with that for sure.

331
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.370
Nicolas Massart: Okay, great cool Thank you.

332
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.560
Grace Hartley: All right, anything else.

333
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.970
Grace Hartley: Thanks for everyone's time see you on discord.

334
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:47.370
Justin Florentine: yeah.

335
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:48.510
Francesco Andreoli: hi good.

336
00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.580
Nicolas Massart: Thank you bye.
