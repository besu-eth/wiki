1
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.410
Jason Frame: it's like the old minutes for people to learn.

2
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.060
Sally MacFarlane: hi.

3
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.420
Jason Frame: 90 minutes.

4
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.970
Danno Ferrin: i'm still working on getting my audio so.

5
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.470
Danno Ferrin: So who's conducting a meeting.

6
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.490
Jason Frame: yeah i'm doing today Square.

7
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.930
Jason Frame: For get started actually spoke to about five paths that I think we're going to bring more people.

8
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.260
Danno Ferrin: Okay, if there's a wait till five colleagues must must not must not have.

9
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.210
Jason Frame: My head actually i'm not sure how long will usually wait I just thought it'd be nicer.

10
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.310
Jason Frame: Number give you.

11
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.090
Jason Frame: Time to grow.

12
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.930
Sally MacFarlane: And people want said arriving till five paths.

13
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.970
Jason Frame: exactly right.

14
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.510
Jason Frame: I think there's probably there's probably enough time for people, we can get started.

15
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.340
Jason Frame: share my screen.

16
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.520
Jason Frame: start with the housekeeping.

17
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:36.300
Jason Frame: So this is a burger by by the antitrust policy there you can get all the haka like to welcome rational that.

18
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.640
Jason Frame: Just a reminder that this meeting is being recorded and stay on mute.

19
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.240
Jason Frame: Unless you're speaking in you can use the right time to ask questions.

20
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.790
Jason Frame: All right, let's uh you know doesn't look like there's any general announcements, but.

21
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.430
Jason Frame: With anyone here, is there any general announcements that anyone, like to make.

22
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.260
Danno Ferrin: i'm hyper ledger global forum will be happening in four weeks does that, when the next call next be.

23
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.830
Danno Ferrin: So yeah this is next call is scheduled to be during the.

24
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.440
Danno Ferrin: week before we go to calendar.

25
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.920
Danno Ferrin: But I don't know if they're going to stream the talks if they're going to record them and post them later I don't know what the plan is there.

26
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.580
Jason Frame: Okay.

27
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.550
Danno Ferrin: Well, to.

28
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.080
Danno Ferrin: yeah global forum will be during this during this call next.

29
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.940
Danno Ferrin: it'll be in the middle, the night when everyone's sleeping.

30
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.110
Jason Frame: alright.

31
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.990
Sally MacFarlane: So it's not any conflict with this call, as such, but it will be on it that.

32
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.650
Danno Ferrin: Just everyone that's on site will be sleeping because it's gonna be in the middle there.

33
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.300
Jason Frame: Right okay.

34
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.060
Jason Frame: So there's probably no name.

35
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:04.200
Jason Frame: Key things that he needs to change the this meaning, you know what do you think this means is really a time that.

36
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.420
Jason Frame: You know people think they doing.

37
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.120
Danno Ferrin: The problem changing any meeting time and skipping cadences everyone gets out all out of schedule.

38
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.680
Jason Frame: yeah it's true it's probably better just to keep it actually like people must recording but.

39
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.170
Jason Frame: yeah.

40
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.950
Jason Frame: And, are there any guys there but it talks that they have a live chat.

41
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.180
Danno Ferrin: there's a few i'm giving one talking about.

42
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:47.670
Danno Ferrin: My experience migraines easy stuff to head era and some of the issues you might experience courting on an edm virtual machine.

43
00:07:48.330 --> 00:08:01.980
Danno Ferrin: into a blockchain it's not necessarily a standard ethereum chain there's there's a lot of subtle differences, so I think there's about another 30 minutes of time there about three minutes of content, which is linked to the talk, I saw one on a schedule about.

44
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:12.180
Danno Ferrin: The POs transition for based Su and there's a couple of industry, talks are some of the industry partners partners through using basic so some talks out there with that.

45
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.760
Jason Frame: sounds interesting collect the links afterwards.

46
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.590
What some.

47
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.920
Jason Frame: More later on in and I don't know if there's been any changes to the pricing right in there.

48
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:36.150
Jason Frame: So I think yeah we've already gotten to talk about.

49
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.820
Jason Frame: Fish I know right so we'll talk about that I don't see anything else.

50
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.450
Danno Ferrin: about it there's a lot more basic talks and I thought.

51
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.730
Jason Frame: yeah that's good.

52
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.590
Jason Frame: They want to talk about I think in the roadmap.

53
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.800
Danno Ferrin: So i've got the Shanghai update and the work updates.

54
00:08:59.280 --> 00:08:59.520
yeah.

55
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.090
Danno Ferrin: performance will follow, and we need to get to Shanghai stuff done first before we work on the performance ideas I have.

56
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:12.210
Jason Frame: All right, well yeah let's talk about the general work updates that's the next one anyway sorry not not quite.

57
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:20.640
Jason Frame: So there's the 28 point 7.1 release plan early next week so that's has to be for the 22nd I believe.

58
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.340
Jason Frame: So they'll be coming out.

59
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:32.880
Jason Frame: Is there anything else on the the update other than the obvious change that needs to go in with the day any change for my name.

60
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:42.960
Danno Ferrin: um so my chitchat with the American them on the slack it's mostly focused on merge and.

61
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.160
Jason Frame: That makes sense.

62
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.870
Danno Ferrin: And the vibe I get as if it's not critical for merge, we should think about not getting getting point one.

63
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:56.250
Jason Frame: And that's a good point so you should buy anything it's not critical to make sure that's a solid really is.

64
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.430
Danno Ferrin: yeah it's critical go ahead and put it into it's not critical especially.

65
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.750
Danno Ferrin: If it's experimental for the sake of being experimental it's the wrong release to go in.

66
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.100
yeah.

67
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.240
Sally MacFarlane: There was a bug.

68
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.140
i'm.

69
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:19.830
Sally MacFarlane: talking point like skipping a block and not going back and catching up so that fixes gone in it's been that, so I think there's a few people waiting on that one.

70
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.160
Jason Frame: Okay.

71
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.950
Jason Frame: just go soon too late, breaking up there really is a critical updates.

72
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.090
Jason Frame: don't let it go to this nice afterwards as we.

73
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.050
Jason Frame: move on to our updates and so I.

74
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.400
Jason Frame: didn't have any updates on the on the Shanghai.

75
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.810
Jason Frame: I think you mentioned something about that, before.

76
00:10:50.310 --> 00:11:03.600
Danno Ferrin: yeah i've got a couple of Shanghai updates, so the first question for Shanghai, is how do we want to manage it it's been a year it's been London since we've had a regular feature feature fork.

77
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.120
Danno Ferrin: Since London everything's been merged and all this crazy we architected for the engineer guy.

78
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:18.510
Danno Ferrin: um so we're kind of out of practice for this, and the question is, when do we want to open up the Shanghai block in the config.

79
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:26.850
Danno Ferrin: And how do we want to do we want to bring other experimental features in and how do we want to protect it, I know, we had Berlin and.

80
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:35.700
Danno Ferrin: For Berlin we put a feature flag in that you had to do a coi flag to enable it until the Berlin features were locked in on an awkward desk call.

81
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:50.970
Danno Ferrin: And i'm wondering if that's the same practice, we want to do for Shanghai and for other experimental features that anything that's not locked in as a specification on awkward deb's requires a feature flags enabled on the command line to explicitly and deliberately turn it on.

82
00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.750
Jason Frame: I think your facts sounds like a very sensible approach to me at least anywhere.

83
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.580
Danno Ferrin: Okay.

84
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:11.670
Jason Frame: your thoughts I guess, we can continue the conversation in the in the discord but.

85
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:13.710
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

86
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:19.770
Danno Ferrin: i'll get a PR together to pitch that because some of my stuff is getting ready to come in Shanghai targeted.

87
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:20.850
yeah.

88
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.370
Jason Frame: Thanks for whoever added that in.

89
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:25.830
Jason Frame: Thanks.

90
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:39.180
Jason Frame: yeah we can can see a conversation but yeah I think that feature flags sounds like a really sensible approach I guess we're not going to know for a while what's actually going to be official in Shanghai.

91
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.510
Jason Frame: there's also a simulated Shanghai vm.

92
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.230
Jason Frame: work outside here is that also thank you.

93
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.550
Jason Frame: yeah you're.

94
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.060
Danno Ferrin: The first line is my first line is nice stuff um.

95
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.270
Danno Ferrin: So if you click on the Shanghai blue link up.

96
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.560
Danno Ferrin: To levels.

97
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.610
Danno Ferrin: That goes to the what is the roadmap that they have set up for it.

98
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.590
Danno Ferrin: And there are six VIP consider for inclusion.

99
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.560
Danno Ferrin: Right now that's as official as Shanghai, as I mean.

100
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.110
Danno Ferrin: The point that we're at is there finally pulling out of the fog of shipping the merge, and we need to start thinking about.

101
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:22.470
Danno Ferrin: The other features for 4895 is going to be the big one be contained withdrawals.

102
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.330
Danno Ferrin: And that's you know something that hasn't been defined very well yet.

103
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:46.440
Danno Ferrin: I assume that you know either either just an A Gary you're probably going to work on that one does that's mostly involved with the work they've been doing on the merge and then that's not firm yet, but all the other features are almost entirely backlog dvm features a push zero instruction.

104
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:53.100
Danno Ferrin: code jumps limit meter Nick code warm the code 20 days.

105
00:13:54.810 --> 00:14:03.270
Danno Ferrin: And so the top for the Elf ones get ready has some stuff not merged yet make merge the push zero instruction visits it's like a trivial instruction to do.

106
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:10.080
Danno Ferrin: But some of the other ones are getting ready to get some implementations ready for for some of these features so.

107
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:28.290
Danno Ferrin: The ones that I have halfway there are 3540 and 36 seven easy and logic format and code validation and i'm getting ready to work to wire those in which is why I brought up those issues with getting in Shanghai block and figure out how to bring those features in.

108
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.640
Danno Ferrin: So that the to the ips i'm working on right now.

109
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:40.830
Danno Ferrin: I mean they work there's there's a small amount of test cases there's another tip out there that isn't included in Shanghai yet.

110
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:52.080
Danno Ferrin: But the need for it came up since the the merge went in full focus mode and that is transmitted storage T store and see load operations and the intent for this here is that.

111
00:14:54.750 --> 00:15:00.210
Danno Ferrin: They need some sort of a whiteboard that can be shared across call contexts, not just in call frame so if i'm.

112
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:08.400
Danno Ferrin: One contract and I call someone else and they called me back that I have something to work with, and right now the only real option, they have is a storage.

113
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:15.750
Danno Ferrin: Which is kind of expensive and pointless if they know they're going to clear it so what they're asking for is a transient storage that's attached to each.

114
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:27.270
Danno Ferrin: Each accounts through the execution and again, subject to the same rollback rules as as a store and memory, and this would be for you know any context that uses that account, no matter.

115
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:36.840
Danno Ferrin: Where they're on stack and whether they come back or not, and that is the name you click on the PR it's another person that's working on it.

116
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:39.870
Danno Ferrin: Because I see the.

117
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.420
Jason Frame: Report where.

118
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.450
Danno Ferrin: that's not the link, I meant to put in there.

119
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:58.620
Danno Ferrin: But he's he's basically got a working implementation against the test so that's one that's probably going to be a good candidate for Shanghai as well, so there's a couple of these changes coming into the vm.

120
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:14.610
Danno Ferrin: Like they've got tests ready to go and the reference test format and it's been working I feel bad because i'm sandbagging it on them, because I don't want it to go into laughter the merge update goes so.

121
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.170
Jason Frame: Go.

122
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.270
Danno Ferrin: Live systems first so.

123
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:28.890
Jason Frame: yeah and so you think the things like this, the picture flag as well that makes sense, like this is.

124
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.330
Jason Frame: Yes, yeah.

125
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.380
Danno Ferrin: Yes.

126
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.510
Danno Ferrin: I think those should have a feature flags.

127
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.770
Danno Ferrin: On this was when he happy 5059 before it was booked in London, it was.

128
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.710
Danno Ferrin: gated behind a similar feature flags.

129
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:45.360
Danno Ferrin: So.

130
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.080
Jason Frame: makes a lot of sense.

131
00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:02.190
Jason Frame: anymore, you might want to add to work tights or even on a timeline.

132
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.310
Jason Frame: type is a nice now.

133
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.530
Jason Frame: With a smaller business here so.

134
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.240
Jason Frame: When an idea that CRM integration, I saw that PR.

135
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:20.790
Jason Frame: comes through.

136
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.030
Jason Frame: The way nice what the status of that is.

137
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.100
Danno Ferrin: Not just what I read on chat.

138
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:46.620
Jason Frame: yeah I know that there's a PR open for for doing exactly that I don't know much else about this anyone have any thoughts on whether it's the right thing to do, we may have to get her direction so.

139
00:17:51.150 --> 00:18:05.790
Danno Ferrin: So one thing that was pointed out by by Ray Jones online, is that we only have about three months of circle ci credits left and hyper ledger foundation doesn't really want to re up the circle ci credits.

140
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.230
Danno Ferrin: So that's one of the things pushing this migration.

141
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:25.380
Danno Ferrin: You know, we could you know, probably, you know, put the heavy on them and make them do the circle ci if we wanted to but there's a lot of things that going to get have access to make easier it's whole song and dance we've had with.

142
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.170
Danno Ferrin: With getting the sonar stuff fixed would have been a lot easier on github actions, instead of circle ci.

143
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:47.640
Danno Ferrin: So there are some advantages there a little bit cheaper I think hyper ledger has a better deal with it so it's going to be more proven with hyper ledger response to go to circle ci and apparently wants done all the work for us so.

144
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.750
Sally MacFarlane: yeah I think.

145
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:03.330
Sally MacFarlane: For Madison and get have action is going to make some things easier i'm not sure about the cost when we looked at this, a while ago.

146
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:11.400
Sally MacFarlane: josh from our Dev OPS team looked into it and he thought that.

147
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:21.150
Sally MacFarlane: Get her actions was actually going to work out to be more expensive plus some like the compute heavy stuff that we do in circle ci right now.

148
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.920
Sally MacFarlane: But i'm not sure that we can know that, until we actually.

149
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:34.380
Sally MacFarlane: Do the migration so i'm not sure where we stand, you know I don't know where that leaves us with the contact that.

150
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:51.180
Danno Ferrin: So I kind of wish I was on that call because I also wonder, do we have circle ci set up to do releases to I mean get have my actions to do releases to because I think circle ci got some specialist josh set up to do releases for us.

151
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.400
Jason Frame: yeah I think they went on mercury that's the X men so.

152
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:08.940
Sally MacFarlane: yeah we do have separate tasks in the car to publish the oddest docs Is that what you mean tomorrow publish them to.

153
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:14.970
Danno Ferrin: Right, so when when when circle ci detects a version of.

154
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.010
Danno Ferrin: Its.

155
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.290
Sally MacFarlane: place in the name.

156
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:20.940
Danno Ferrin: Right.

157
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.710
Danno Ferrin: yeah and I think it's in the actual.

158
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.350
Sally MacFarlane: An APP look in the details on this trigger somehow magically.

159
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.820
Danno Ferrin: The branches have different issues, I think it's when when we put a tag on there.

160
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:42.630
Danno Ferrin: Which is something that automatically doesn't build, but it does more pushes and more final stuff.

161
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.480
Sally MacFarlane: yeah yeah basically publishing and the docker.

162
00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:02.310
Sally MacFarlane: questions that we have been on this, or do we need to get input from the.

163
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.570
Danno Ferrin: Other questions or.

164
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.210
Danno Ferrin: When we want to switch over can be handled releases.

165
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:18.480
Jason Frame: and carry idea what the if it has any impact on the bill time does it comparable to circle car.

166
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.160
Danno Ferrin: No idea.

167
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:21.540
Jason Frame: yeah.

168
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.990
Jason Frame: And it feels quite long as it is.

169
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.170
Danno Ferrin: it's yeah it's a lot of stuff like the qb empty container chests really added to it.

170
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.690
Danno Ferrin: And we keep adding more tests, the tests never go down.

171
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.280
Danno Ferrin: there's a number of tests.

172
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.100
Jason Frame: yeah unfortunately that.

173
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.410
Jason Frame: yeah my time for this i'm just i'm just going about that one which really.

174
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.990
Jason Frame: didn't want to go through the metrics.

175
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.300
Jason Frame: And we've got saying here in the.

176
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.440
Jason Frame: paper form here.

177
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.380
Jason Frame: about the yuppie process, possibly changing for the craft Q well.

178
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.630
Sally MacFarlane: yeah I put that in there, I don't understand.

179
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.120
Sally MacFarlane: And i've asked you know, no one seems to really understand.

180
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.380
Sally MacFarlane: what's going on with the IP process does anyone think.

181
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.820
Danno Ferrin: Organized chaos.

182
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:35.940
Danno Ferrin: So.

183
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:47.400
Danno Ferrin: what's happened in the past year um This is my half and half a perspective of what's going on as a lot of the core developers just don't don't use it anymore.

184
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:56.250
Danno Ferrin: um one of the problems is the IP editors have some very strange rules and it's very difficult to get them to get your stuff merge and proposed.

185
00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:02.970
Danno Ferrin: and other core developers just plain old don't like writing them they don't want to write these the ips and socialize that they just want to write their code.

186
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:11.610
Danno Ferrin: Post a web page with their spec and say hey you have to let this now there's been pushed back from a number of developers that they just don't want to do the Iraqi process.

187
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.970
Danno Ferrin: And it's like oh come on it's been in client expert so many years, there was copy that can we just standardize it.

188
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:27.270
Danno Ferrin: So, and that also goes in with some of the editors we don't have a very formal and very strict process, and one of the biggest.

189
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.610
Danno Ferrin: Complaints is that we can't do external links.

190
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:38.520
Danno Ferrin: And then they can't get enough editors to to uphold this and so there's a couple of repose that have opened up there's execution specs.

191
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:49.590
Danno Ferrin: And and a consensus specs and also execution api's and where this comes in, with graph que well is the core depth to do networking on clients, other than they Sue.

192
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:58.410
Danno Ferrin: For the most part, decided that we're not doing ips we can do everything execution api's and we're just going to specify it there and we're not going to pay any attention to it, yet the repo.

193
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:09.810
Danno Ferrin: So this execution api's repose being seated from some of the spec and also some of the current implementation so arguments of saying that you know hey your graph que El doesn't follow us back, they just say we don't care.

194
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:19.920
Danno Ferrin: We follow the execution API and execution API just came from a dump from their graph que El endpoint so it's it's a deterioration the standardization process.

195
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:28.350
Danno Ferrin: And i'm not terribly happy about it but it's where we're at so the way to play this game is to is to get their execution API specs updated.

196
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:34.170
Danno Ferrin: and move it towards it, so I actually went into the execution API spec and.

197
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:47.580
Danno Ferrin: added a graph que El schema rather than using the javascript schema that they've been using to validate that not every it isn't really even standard Dracula, and so my next step now that this is in is i'm going to roll back some of the changes that came in that weren't.

198
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:54.690
Danno Ferrin: weren't part of the spec and actually contradict the spec in the VIP and get that to be the standard.

199
00:24:55.350 --> 00:25:03.810
Danno Ferrin: and actually have this battle is that the standard matter, or is it what a particular client of lists that matters and just.

200
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:13.260
Danno Ferrin: dirt there needs to be a winner from this, it needs to be one way or the other, and if it's not going to be there we're gonna have sex and let's get rid of this kabuki dance and let's just do with the client say.

201
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:21.180
Danno Ferrin: This middle ground or pretending we have specs and then not following them is is is detrimental it's going to burn us.

202
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:33.330
Danno Ferrin: So this brings us closer this PR that I have now that the other specs merge brings us closer to the IP specs and some of the things have changed on graph key well and that I think are good and some things that are not good.

203
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.600
Danno Ferrin: 2930 and 5059 changes are good so we'll just take what was proposed by the other client indirectly.

204
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:50.100
Danno Ferrin: Adding the receipt Ross I think is useful, but there are some other things that they've changed, such as making fields optional that were required required fields that are optional.

205
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:59.010
Danno Ferrin: and adding fields that no other API in all of json rpc uses to the spec and it just doesn't make sense to implement that.

206
00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:04.530
Danno Ferrin: So those are the some some of the battles and planning to have in the next couple of weeks on the execution API PR.

207
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:14.280
Danno Ferrin: But once you know now that the the main spec of getting graphical spec is, and I think we can commit the accident, we can't commit it now we're going to wait until after the marriage happens.

208
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:14.940
Danno Ferrin: to live by.

209
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.350
pitch.

210
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.270
Sally MacFarlane: yeah good thanks Dan I that's good additional context.

211
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.060
Danno Ferrin: So yeah it's not an ideal place.

212
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:31.500
Danno Ferrin: Or you know there's there's a lot of work that people couldn't the IP and it's really disappointing to see four players ignore it and dismiss it.

213
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.750
Danno Ferrin: And there's no teeth to it if you're not a compliant with the IP there's no teeth to it, no one cares.

214
00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.860
Danno Ferrin: it's not like there's a conformance spec that you can push and they'll just change the conformance back to match their.

215
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.540
Danno Ferrin: Their implementation anyway so it's.

216
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.410
Danno Ferrin: Now this is the joys of decentralized standardized standard making.

217
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:10.020
Jason Frame: So Carlos and Carlos know aspect, it anyway thanks for that, then I, and I think I also recorded or.

218
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:20.130
Jason Frame: Maybe awkward Davis was saying that I will try to do, probably both processes at once in a while see what works for yes i'm interested to see what happens.

219
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.940
Jason Frame: I think that might be everything will go on the agenda there.

220
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.570
Jason Frame: Is anything else anyone wants to.

221
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:32.940
Jason Frame: Cover while we're here.

222
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.730
Jason Frame: All right, okay there's no stop sharing.

223
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:51.840
Sally MacFarlane: Thanks.

224
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:53.820
Danno Ferrin: Thanks.

225
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.220
Sally MacFarlane: Everyone on.

226
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:57.090
Gabriel Fukushima: But thanks.
