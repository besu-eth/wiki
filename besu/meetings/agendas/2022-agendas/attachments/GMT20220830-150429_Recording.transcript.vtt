00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.640
Danno Ferrin: And let me share my screen.

2
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.030
Um

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.489
Danno Ferrin: great. So now that that fun task is over with

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.130
Francesco Andreoli: um,

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:31.440
Francesco Andreoli: welcome to the what is today the thirtieth of August meeting for Hyper Ledger basso. On the housekeeping items. There is a code of conduct, and there is antitrust

6
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:40.920
Danno Ferrin: rules. Learn those and follow those be excellent to each other. You don't do anything where it wouldn't let you do a quick non-minding summary of what those are.

7
00:00:41.150 --> 00:01:00.670
Danno Ferrin: Um general announcements in two weeks is going to be the Hyper Ledger Global forum. Um. Some leaks, went on Discord. If you want to attend meetings virtually, that's an option. Now, um travel still kind of not perfect. So there's people who still aren't traveling, So that's why they're one of the reasons they're over putting up the virtual meetings for some of this. Um,

8
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.309
Danno Ferrin: there's always, if you want anything in the developer Newsletter that goes out every Saturday. There's a page you can submit. I can put those in the notes.

9
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.509
Danno Ferrin: Is there any other general announcements or release updates before we get into work updates that need to go out?

10
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.790
Matt Nelson: No, just that me and you are both giving talks. So.

11
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:34.170
Danno Ferrin: Yes, for those that watch the recording. If you're looking for the schedule, both Dan and I will be giving basic related talks, and they're on to Monday.

12
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.440
Danno Ferrin: Hg: F. Let's just get

13
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.319
Danno Ferrin: I think they're on.

14
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.930
Danno Ferrin: So one thousand four hundred and fifty Ireland time. Someone's giving it a talk. Let me put my windows around,

15
00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.909
Danno Ferrin: not consensus. That's an interesting one. I'm giving my talk at four, thirty on the hedera integration, and then

16
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:11.410
Danno Ferrin: giving you a keynote. That's a It's a big coup right there. Okay,

17
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.890
Danno Ferrin: Who else?

18
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.390
Danno Ferrin: Mine was? Mine must have fallen off or not. Have the name? Be su in it. But anyway, it's on there. So

19
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.090
Danno Ferrin: now here we go. Yeah, from an infant client to an execution engine that's for Bath and Francesca. Yeah.

20
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.970
Matt Nelson: Okay,

21
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.940
Danno Ferrin: here.

22
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.150
Danno Ferrin: So that's yeah. So we got a keynote. That's That's

23
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.190
Danno Ferrin: I'm: on the Tsc: And this is the first I've heard about that keynote. So this. This is a big deal,

24
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.629
Matt Nelson: but it'll be good to see Tim, that's nice.

25
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.059
Danno Ferrin: Yeah, like a day before the merge, which is a huge surprise,

26
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.110
Danno Ferrin: right? Yeah, because the merge is becoming earlier. That is kind of a surprise.

27
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.230
Danno Ferrin: Okay. So releases. We had um

28
00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:09.790
Danno Ferrin: twenty-two seven one went up last week. Um, Everyone should upgrade to that, and I do mean to everyone. Um, there's got some important merge updates um, and so let's go to work updates. I guess Justin's on for merge updates if you want to go ahead and leave us through.

29
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.130
Justin Florentine: Hello,

30
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.389
Justin Florentine: yeah. So I think you kind of covered it honestly. Two thousand two hundred and seventy. One was our big release before the merge. We want everybody to be running

31
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:32.490
Justin Florentine: So that's that's out there. It's baking in. We're. We're observing it and our local canaries. Here. We're fueling reports from ah folks in the field that have been upgrading to it. We're addressing our issues, et cetera.

32
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:50.330
Justin Florentine: Um! So what we imagine moving forward is that a future release? Two thousand two hundred and seventy two would be things that we find that are relevant to the merge. Um! That's kind of the next topic of discussion. It's like. What would a twenty-seven twenty-two, seven, two release look like, And how do we want it to go.

33
00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:01.510
Justin Florentine: Um. So you know, I I think that we probably want to keep things fairly stable, considering it's like the last opportunity for a release before the merge.

34
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.160
Justin Florentine: Um, Does that

35
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:22.740
Danno Ferrin: go ahead? I have some. So yeah, yeah, I know um. So I guess the question is, is, you know, do we want to keep this, as you know, merge specific as possible? Or do we want to treat this like any other release that comes off of Maine, and you know, pull in what we would normally pull in for a bi-weekly release.

36
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.590
Danno Ferrin: So one of my concerns with making this this would be the second cherry pick release in a row, because two thousand two hundred and seventy one was a cherry. That course

37
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:50.380
Danno Ferrin: not. Every commit that was on me made it into the release which is, which goes against everything we've done for the past several years in releasing this. So what that would mean is that between twenty, two, seven and two thousand and two a distance of over two months, we would not have any mainline releases. Where stuff that gets committed to main is released in a released candidate

38
00:04:50.390 --> 00:05:04.270
Danno Ferrin: in the not release candidate in a regular release. And this we're letting the needs of one network dominate the entire project, and I Don't think that's healthy for the project to do. Two cherry-pick releases in a row and then shut down into Rcs.

39
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:23.280
Gary Schulte: I agree that's not fair to the to non-etherium projects. But I mean this is probably one of the largest events in in blockchain history. It's it's probably wise to go and do that. If we. I think if we want to have another mainline release

40
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:33.209
Gary Schulte: following hot on the heels of two thousand two hundred and seventy two, that I think that would be a good compromise that way. We don't have this case where we have two months without a mainline release. But I think that just

41
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:43.879
Gary Schulte: there's an awful lot on the line, and an awful lot of complexity around the merge. I think that it warrants a cherry pick in this case, and I think we can mitigate the two month problem.

42
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:55.590
Justin Florentine: Yeah, I I think I concur with what Gary saying. Maybe we should pull up two thousand two hundred and ten as an Rc. And kind of have two releases that are out there at a time. Would that be an option?

43
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:13.810
Danno Ferrin: So twenty-two set as an Rc. Is Still, it's an Rc. It's not a release. It says user production. It's still stuck in Beta. It doesn't get pushed up to home through. So anything that goes in the main would not be questioned. The home group from August the third, it's August, the nineteenth, unless it passes

44
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.009
Danno Ferrin: some network standard of it's good.

45
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.350
Gary Schulte: What if we were to just,

46
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.660
Gary Schulte: you know, accelerate two thousand two hundred and seventy-three that way.

47
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:41.290
Gary Schulte: We could still have some some expectation of isolation around. You know the future set that's going into the last merge release. But we could also still break this stalemate, this log gem of two months without a main release.

48
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:54.879
Justin Florentine: I think I think the numbering there would be confusing to users gearing if i'm if i'm running twenty, two, seven, one now, and I see a two thousand two hundred and seventy three drop. I'm going to try and run that as opposed to a two thousand two hundred and ten, I get a little bit more about

49
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.439
Justin Florentine: indication that this is in the future.

50
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.660
Gary Schulte: Yeah, I agree with that.

51
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.630
Gary Schulte: Oh,

52
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.029
Gary Schulte: what if I mean if this is kind of merge timing dependent. But

53
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.439
Gary Schulte: what if we just have a twenty, two, seven, three mainline drop after the merge

54
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.270
Gary Schulte: after the big scary event has happened?

55
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.780
Gary Schulte: Oh, there you go! There's less risk.

56
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.559
Danno Ferrin: And what would that look like on the schedule?

57
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:31.590
Gary Schulte: That's risky. What is the hashtag right where the two thousand two hundred and ten? Rc. One is right. Now

58
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.840
Matt Nelson: is the director. Twenty-two.

59
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.360
Matt Nelson: Is there any precedent to do like

60
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:54.250
Gary Schulte: kind of a special release? That we would just say like this is for the merge, and then we also put out a twenty, two, seven, two from Maine, and then we just tell users to that effect what is what we've never the releases. It was, as I said, there was a

61
00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:14.100
Gary Schulte: There's a a precedent for doing a a prior quarter point release in the same same cadence as a release candidate release, so we could do twenty, two, ten, zero, Rc. One at the same time. We do two thousand two hundred and seventy, three, and potentially accelerate that

62
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.550
Gary Schulte: the September the twenty first release.

63
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:28.449
Danno Ferrin: So now that I'm. Editing Rose, what was the specific proposal,

64
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:34.360
Gary Schulte: I just proposed that we were at least twenty, two, seven, three on the same cycle as two thousand two hundred and ten zero Rc. One.

65
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:43.649
Gary Schulte: We could just do the same same way we did the Rc. Release for twenty, two, seven, zero, Rc. One and twenty, two, four.

66
00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:57.990
Gary Schulte: When we do where we'll releases in our C's. What we start doing is we start cherry-picking into the old release line, and it only gets cut on demand for bugs we've done that for we did that for the magneto release on etherium classic.

67
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.420
Danno Ferrin: And um

68
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.640
Danno Ferrin: yeah, we've done we we the cherry that we

69
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.739
Danno Ferrin: when we do when we do splits, there's always one that has the main line one that just has cherry picks.

70
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:20.570
Gary Schulte: Yeah, there really wouldn't be any difference at this point between two thousand two hundred and seventy, three, and twenty, two, ten, one zero, or twenty, two, ten, zero, Rc: one

71
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:27.080
Gary Schulte: that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, does it other than that. It's just going to be a an additional main release.

72
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.669
Gary Schulte: It would essentially be identical, as in version number

73
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.860
my calendar.

74
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.470
Danno Ferrin: Well, it's the two weeks after November the sixteenth. It's not, it's the thirtieth.

75
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.360
Danno Ferrin: So what if we shifted this all down one week

76
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.940
Danno Ferrin: like that?

77
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.519
Gary Schulte: I think that's reasonable

78
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.499
Gary Schulte: that one week or one cycle,

79
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.589
because we can shift it down fourteen. But that's going to be the day of the release. There's we don't want to do a release on the day of the march.

80
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.710
Gary Schulte: There's yeah,

81
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.810
Gary Schulte: yeah,

82
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.060
Gary Schulte: that would be problematic.

83
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.080
Gary Schulte: I think that's reasonable.

84
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:24.269
Danno Ferrin: Okay. And I still just want to get out there that the cherry pick unannounced on two thousand and seven one.

85
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.390
Danno Ferrin: That's not cool.

86
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:32.500
Danno Ferrin: If you're going to a cherry pick, you need to announce it publicly and ask for release for for those and make sure everyone's on board with it instead of just doing it.

87
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.500
Danno Ferrin: Yeah.

88
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.310
Danno Ferrin: Okay.

89
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.970
Danno Ferrin: So how does that look?

90
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.569
Gary Schulte: No, It's great That will.

91
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.860
Danno Ferrin: It's cool.

92
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:08.789
Danno Ferrin: So let's go ahead and update that. What are the two week cycles after? What are the December days? Does anyone have a camera?

93
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.940
Matt Nelson: Yeah, I'm looking at it. It is following. The thirtieth is the fourteenth, and then the twenty eighth.

94
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.590
Matt Nelson: So the fourteenth uh would be exactly to it.

95
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.470
Matt Nelson: Yes,

96
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.329
Danno Ferrin: okay. Beneath is kind of a crappy day to do a release. But

97
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.089
Gary Schulte: do we to historically release on the kind of end of your holiday?

98
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.740
Danno Ferrin: It's two weeks.

99
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.760
Gary Schulte: Yeah, there might not be much to release, but it should be mostly automated.

100
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.480
Gary Schulte: Okay, What's January? Look like

101
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:41.450
Matt Nelson: after this? Twenty eighth We have the eleventh of January and the twenty fifth of January. The

102
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:50.199
Danno Ferrin: Okay. And February is the eighth of February and twenty second of February.

103
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:02.010
Danno Ferrin: And when do we want to land twenty, three, one What's our target? Date here? Twenty fifth

104
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.989
Danno Ferrin: or February eighth,

105
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:16.609
Gary Schulte: twenty fifth, seems. Oh, that makes sense to me. I mean we could. We could do the eleventh and the twenty eighth as the Rc. Candidates here.

106
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.780
Justin Florentine: Yep.

107
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:38.119
Gary Schulte: Notice we had a couple of releases where we omitted the zero in the Release Candidate Series is that is that no mission or okay?

108
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.790
Danno Ferrin: Yeah, that's just me typing it wrong.

109
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.599
Gary Schulte: Okay,

110
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.990
Gary Schulte: I think we we briefly had a snapshot version

111
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.850
Gary Schulte: with with that with that syntax. I was wondering if that was something that we were.

112
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.760
Gary Schulte: I was on the same page for

113
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.080
Danno Ferrin: probably a

114
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.659
Danno Ferrin: screw up,

115
00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.329
Danno Ferrin: and I also want to sense of calling these Rcs as we should switch to calling these betas

116
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.640
Danno Ferrin: because we're releasing in our C where we're intending on changing more. It's not really really his candidate.

117
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:11.190
Gary Schulte: Yeah, that's a good point. We're Still, if we're releasing from Maine, then it's not really a release candidate that we're going to trade back into.

118
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.079
Danno Ferrin: Ooh what we do, beta that our C.

119
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.310
Danno Ferrin: That works.

120
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:30.540
Justin Florentine: I think So I think. Yeah. So we just make the set the level set that the Rc. Is emerge as a cherry pick. Only release it,

121
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.190
he

122
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.120
you!

123
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.479
Gary Schulte: But we probably need to document that change somewhere just to so that

124
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:06.090
Gary Schulte: whoever's doing the release at that point is aware. I mean, it's good That the notes column is is probably more than sufficient. But it

125
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.089
Danno Ferrin: yeah, I think I need to optimize this process.

126
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.549
Gary Schulte: Yeah, and talk about how once we're in a beta cycle, how we can still do

127
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.029
Danno Ferrin: point releases from the previous on a cherry-pick basis.

128
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.690
Gary Schulte: Look at that

129
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.190
Danno Ferrin: it as well as one.

130
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.660
Danno Ferrin: You should put on my multiple screens. I want to edit this.

131
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.650
Danno Ferrin: Okay,

132
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.350
Danno Ferrin: Does that capture what we discussed?

133
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.720
Matt Nelson: I think so.

134
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.390
Danno Ferrin: Okay,

135
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.259
Matt Nelson: Maybe that move to to Beta's as opposed to Rc:

136
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.419
Matt Nelson: That's the last note.

137
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.210
Danno Ferrin: Okay,

138
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.159
problem. Martha needs to be explicitly said

139
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:04.489
Danno Ferrin: that we'll move out the dot zero releases needed based on the Rc. Health.

140
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.910
Danno Ferrin: But it's no sooner than two weeks

141
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.789
from our C.

142
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:26.699
Gary Schulte: Yeah, I actually really like that, just because sometimes it makes no sense to have a second release candidate. When the first release candidate was successful,

143
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:27.890
Gary Schulte: it's.

144
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.740
Gary Schulte: Yes, it makes a lot of sense,

145
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.560
Gary Schulte: you know it's clear,

146
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.310
Danno Ferrin: cool

147
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.830
Danno Ferrin: you

148
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.010
Danno Ferrin: any other

149
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.560
Danno Ferrin: discussions?

150
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:57.009
Danno Ferrin: I don't think so. Um! We can have the discussion of what's getting cherry-picked into twenty, two, seven, four, two two ah via discord. Yeah. Discords. I think the right place to to coordinate it

151
00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.350
Danno Ferrin: on their least channel.

152
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:05.589
Danno Ferrin: Cool. Um. Next basic code on our discussion.

153
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.799
Danno Ferrin: Yeah, I put this one on here.

154
00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:19.439
Danno Ferrin: I'm pretty sure I've shared the document with most of the people on this call. That's not to say everyone. And again, This is also just to reiterate just a proposal. There's kind of

155
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:36.309
Danno Ferrin: it, was a thought on both sides of the aisle. I will be cleaning up and adjudicating a lot of the comments that people put in. But I think that it's good question. So i'm going to leave them, as is the question is, How do we want to Basically, formally socialize this proposal? And you know,

156
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.139
Danno Ferrin: with the venue, I don't think we're gonna make any progress on it today. So I was mostly just bringing it back up so that we can

157
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.849
Matt Nelson: kind of go off the link.

158
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:52.289
Danno Ferrin: I have the Google Doc Link. I bet maybe the first step is to make a hyper ledger wiki page, and then share within the contributor's discord, and what people have to say

159
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:52.910
Danno Ferrin: the

160
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.690
Matt Nelson: but you know, super high level. It's just about increasing

161
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:11.019
Danno Ferrin: potential kind of release quality. And, Dan, I know you had mentioned the Tsc. Is pushing for a strong ownership model things as well. So just basically us in the direction of the

162
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.670
Matt Nelson: uh, more review,

163
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:29.100
Matt Nelson: and to kind of hopefully not slow our velocity down. But to make sure that we have the right people reviewing certain changes to high impact code base ah components. So that was really the gist of the Maintainer's thing. I'll set up a

164
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.179
Matt Nelson: Wiki page. Um:

165
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:38.110
Matt Nelson: yeah, with basically the Google doc that I've circulated among some folks. And then we can.

166
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:52.189
Matt Nelson: I'll pester people and maybe we discuss on the next contributor call, which is in like a month. I think this is a better post merge discussion, anyway, as we kind of slow down velocity around the merge regardless. So that'll be

167
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.019
Matt Nelson: sent in the contributors channel at some point soon. Um!

168
00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.189
Matt Nelson: Is there any high-level comments from the group on this one

169
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:14.869
Gary Schulte: most market. I'm gonna talk about that just now. Anyway, it's an open link. So anyone with the link should be able to view,

170
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.240
Danno Ferrin: and it's just again. Nothing that anyone's ever.

171
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:28.549
Danno Ferrin: Yeah, Diego, You are basically the person you and Antoine and some others were the only folks that I have been meaning to to send it to. But again, there's no decisions being made. We just wanted to support it.

172
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.030
Matt Nelson: Your feedback

173
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:46.290
Matt Nelson: it might be better to, I mean, if it's not out of process to keep the link here, just because there's a lot of comments already in the Google Doc.

174
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.090
Matt Nelson: But I don't know if

175
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.219
Matt Nelson: we I can do whatever is required, move it to Hyper Ledger. I don't really mind

176
00:19:54.230 --> 00:20:07.589
Danno Ferrin: um. So eventually the final doc is going to need a little on the Wiki. They had issues with this with um fabric. They posted design docs at Google Docs, and they were company on links. And then somebody left their company. And then the Docs got locked.

177
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.090
Matt Nelson: Got it?

178
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:15.480
Matt Nelson: Yeah, Now we will definitely. Once we move to adjudicate on these comments, I can absolutely start a Wiki page.

179
00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:16.490
Danno Ferrin: Okay,

180
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.040
Gary Schulte: I think, the

181
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:30.299
Gary Schulte: but the collaboration for for building a proposal as as opposed to having, I mean, comments are great, but I think, having an open collaborative process is going to give better results, so that we don't just

182
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:48.530
Gary Schulte: have diametrically opposed sides that you know, thumb up or thumb down a proposal from one side or another, so I think that I would like it. Personally, I would like to front load the process of the code owner's proposal ahead of time before we would put it. It's any kind of formal agreement or a thumbs up thumb down. Vote

183
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.060
Danno Ferrin: it's a great it.

184
00:20:52.150 --> 00:21:01.859
Gary Schulte: Okay. So I think a good way for it is to continue to work within this Google Doc, and then one by the next contributors call to have a semi-finalized version that we can

185
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:07.029
Matt Nelson: vote on and discuss as far as like, what we actually want to

186
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:21.180
Matt Nelson: come in, because there's still a ton of like. You can see a billion. There's a billion comments in there that I have not had time to go back and try to adjudicate, and I don't want it also to be me. I don't want it just to be my interpretation of the comments, too. So

187
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:38.889
Danno Ferrin: yeah, I I think we just I i'll. I'll try my best to get everyone's comments in. And if if there's areas where there's contention just put in like caveat things here, here, here and then once I have, like a typed up version that makes sense. I'll put it back in the Wiki, and we can discuss Ah, on the next contributor ball.

188
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.320
Gary Schulte: Okay, from school.

189
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.560
Matt Nelson: Awesome.

190
00:21:46.890 --> 00:22:10.310
Matt Nelson: All right. The next thing is in a similar vein. Um, I tried a crack at updated architecture diagrams for base two, I've made three, one for kind of an overall picture in the code base as it is right now, one focused on kind of the you know, public network, execution side and one public focused on private network execution. So

191
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.350
I

192
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:31.030
Matt Nelson: would love some feedback from the community. Our Our goal is to get this up into the docs eventually, so that users who are looking for information around the merge, and other things will have the right Um! Ah diagrams! So if you haven't seen already on the latest branch of the bay suit docs. There have been split out into public network and private network

193
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:36.639
Matt Nelson: sections, so that users that want. Each functionality can get into the right space without having to

194
00:22:36.650 --> 00:23:04.440
Matt Nelson: get lost in the mix of the docs that Don't relate to what they're doing. Um. But within that process we have not updated the diagram, so I mean, I don't know if we want to, at least just cursorily view them. Now I have a Sigma like Link. I also have pictures, so I don't know what's best to share here, but I can also just share my screen. But regardless, I just wanted to get some feedback on these diagrams. Um, so that I can finalize them, and we can get those up into the Docs

195
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:10.980
Matt Nelson: site. Yeah, i'll just go ahead and share my screen really quickly, and we can take a look at all three.

196
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.480
Matt Nelson: Here we go.

197
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.670
Matt Nelson: So, yeah is is are folks able to see this at a reasonable size?

198
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:29.039
Danno Ferrin: Yes. So again, just to talk through my thinking, It's just a really an update of what everything looks like, kind of in aggregate. And in addition, we've added kind of

199
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:48.400
Matt Nelson: external consensus clients for certain things. I might reword this just to talk about like external consensus as a whole. But again, this is kind of a cut that it now includes. You know, the tri-storage options that we had had specific eft consensus algorithms and some new kind of

200
00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:59.259
Matt Nelson: notions around how we're plugging in consensus. It's not like again. I wanted to find a better way to be able to tie the external consensus to the notion of plausible consensus,

201
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:09.410
Matt Nelson: but I also wanted to not. I might just move this up to the top so that you can. We can kind of tie this all together. But this is the over level overall component. You.

202
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:29.430
Matt Nelson: I will flip back to this, but to really quickly kind of elaborate on what we've done as well. This is kind of just the the public execution, like lean execution format without using private network components where we have kind of global execution partially enabled via the engine. Api, you know. I think we also want to be able to capture the one

203
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:36.809
Matt Nelson: kind of head air. Use face where there's pluggable execution just within the Evm and and other things where we're not exclusively kind of

204
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:47.599
Matt Nelson: removing certain things right. But I wanted to show that it basically is intended to be kind of flexible via these efforts, and I also wanted to kind of te up the

205
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.999
Matt Nelson: compartmentalization work that we've been kicking around, but not

206
00:24:52.210 --> 00:25:11.339
Matt Nelson: really moves towards quite yet in a way that makes sense. But you know the plug of execution also includes all different kinds of stuff, you know. Proof of state consensus working on. You know the pow consensus potentially working, enable. Roll up consensus. So I want to make sure that everyone's use. Cases are adequately captured.

207
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:17.229
Matt Nelson: Um! And i'll, i'll share these in some format that is commentable uh

208
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:26.140
Matt Nelson: post call, or, you know, during the call, so that folks can go in and actually provide comments. And then, lastly, we have just the private execution.

209
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:27.280
Matt Nelson: Ah,

210
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.370
Matt Nelson: environment where you have

211
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:49.399
Matt Nelson: your gaps, and it's pretty typical basso, except instead of luggable consensus around all the different types you have. Pbft, ivf. T. Two Click, W. And you have the inclusion of, you know, optional tasera privacy, stuff, bft, networking, et cetera, et cetera.

212
00:25:51.430 --> 00:26:02.170
Matt Nelson: So that's that's what I had to share on this again. I'll share these out in a method that's commentable, so I can collect some feedback for another round of edits, but I just wanted to share what I've been working on this

213
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.280
Danno Ferrin: um

214
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:19.069
Danno Ferrin: one question there was a pr that came in that was adding a roll-up method to the engine. Api. Were there any docs as to how we we expected to interact with that from an external provider? Or Is that something from another group of consensus that you weren't aware of?

215
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:30.580
Matt Nelson: Yeah. So we've been discussing kind of what that looks like. We're taking a very very much cautious approach in the short term on how we break that out.

216
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:53.890
Matt Nelson: My personal opinion is that we should externalize kind of all that stuff, and do it through some kind of interface via the engine Api not necessarily extending it directly. Um, we haven't gotten too far down that road, because again, you know, although Basu is open source, and those like you, said other groups at consensus who have an interest in potentially opening up some of those components, we want to be kind of risk averse through the merge.

217
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:59.220
Matt Nelson: But we do want not just to enable, you know, specific role of use cases within consensus, but other.

218
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:18.879
Matt Nelson: Ah! Possible infrastructure providers in the community, you know, thinking like optimism, arbitr um, you know, and some of the Zk Ibm or Zk proof roll ups. Excuse me, i'm getting my words tripped up. And how do we do that? Whether we do we extend the Api be a certain set of updates to the engine. Api, where

219
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:32.180
Matt Nelson: you know these roll ups folks can plug in in a way that directly impacts execution, but it does so in a way that is compatible with role of consensus. You know that's what we have yet to figure out. I think that the

220
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:43.389
Matt Nelson: the short-term vision was to extend the engine. Api. But I think that that's a little bit too like It's not fully baked. That's why we're not putting those prs, or you know none of those Prs have been approved or merged.

221
00:27:43.400 --> 00:28:02.230
Danno Ferrin: But yeah, we're definitely thinking through what that would look like, because it's there is interest from community members, including folks outside of consensus to get bas suit in infrastructure for roll-ups, and for some of this other stuff. So I want to make sure that we do this in a thoughtful way. But but this was the first kind of

222
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:18.589
Matt Nelson: thought process here. I think we need to really think about what this pluggable execution actually means for Basu. Does it mean we're interfacing through the engine? Api? Does it mean we're interfacing through something else that goes directly to the Evm? Does it mean we're creating a new interface

223
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:34.999
Matt Nelson: that you know ties even other. You know other things together. But you know essentially, how do we expose access to the Evm in a way that makes sense and doesn't break anything that exists. Now. So the first thought was to use the engineer Api and extend it because it does basically

224
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:54.160
Matt Nelson: allow basically to externalize consensus mechanisms that you would need for a roll up or for something else, anyway. But I think there are risks that come with that that we Haven't explored fully. So at this point in time. It's basically just, you know, create a new Api that can kind of mix in, but again nothing else. There,

225
00:28:54.170 --> 00:29:00.689
Matt Nelson: Gary, I don't know if you have anything to add there. I think that was kind of just. It's very. It's too early, like we haven't really discussed that too much. But

226
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.790
Danno Ferrin: so

227
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:09.620
Gary Schulte: no, I really don't have too much to add to that. I think that this it's a work in progress, and that's about all we can say at the moment. I think

228
00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:31.350
Danno Ferrin: so. Looking at other layer. Two networks out there, I think one thing we also need to consider is the desire to do things like completely top off networking um in like in our which was an arbitrary of our optimism. Um. They don't really do pure discovery as much as they have a centralized um sequencer, so it needs to be a model where there might be a centralized or decentral sequencer in the networking would be significantly different.

229
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:58.719
Danno Ferrin: Um! In the case of like the celestial, they're talking about changing the storage engines to be able to provide, you know. Witness based execution. Um. So I think you know, to to to be um. The best solution for roll ups going forward is to have some of these modular things to be able to chop down. So that was one of my concerns of just going through the interface with the role of the Api, because we're dragging along a lot of features that are unneeded for that style of a by by roll up

230
00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:15.520
Danno Ferrin: when what is needed is, you know, someone's going to give you the transactions you process. Dvm: and calculate the settlement layer in a different tree state, or you might have a different networking. With that you might be gathering your transactions through through Cosmos gossip or through some other gossip network.

231
00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:24.870
Danno Ferrin: So, as we do this, I think we need to keep those modular concepts in mind, too, so that we could pair off to the bare minimum of what's needed for the roll up.

232
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:34.440
Matt Nelson: Yeah. So let me definitely elaborate on that. I think that this is this is a sort of near-term picture. I fully intend to create a

233
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:40.690
Matt Nelson: kind of vision that looks exactly like what you're describing, where we kind of lean into the modular concept a lot more.

234
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:54.539
Matt Nelson: The problem is that I want to have something that works for now. Um, but I I like Yes, you're correct, and we want to work to that vision where each of these individual boxes will be in theory kind of optional, and you only take what you need and discard the rest.

235
00:30:54.550 --> 00:31:15.300
Matt Nelson: Um! But you know that's again. That's like a medium so longer. Term vision post kind of merge context, and I wanted to make sure that we had something that fits this timeline. But yeah, my my intention was absolutely to as we move towards the more environmentalized modular vision to create new versions of these diagrams, and it could even be within the next couple of months right. I just wanted to get something on paper. Now,

236
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.439
Danno Ferrin: Okay, yeah, this reflects what we have today.

237
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:26.030
Matt Nelson: Yeah, yeah, to a degree. Yes, right? And And so that's Why, this fox is like kind of a little bit iffy.

238
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:42.079
Matt Nelson: So you know that's where i'm looking for feedback, but it it more reflects what we have today or within the short term, and I want to. As we move towards those modularity discussions to support different kinds of use cases, we will kind of blow up this box once more and do a new one.

239
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.410
Danno Ferrin: Yeah,

240
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:55.290
Danno Ferrin: yeah, I don't know how we would get these on the week yet. I don't have a fig, my plugin. You might have to capture images.

241
00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:06.390
Matt Nelson: Yeah, I think i'll just. I'll just do a Pdf: i'll share it somewhere, And then people could just put either comments on the thread or put it in the Pdf. It doesn't really matter to me. I already have exports, so it's still

242
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.190
Danno Ferrin: carefully.

243
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.559
Danno Ferrin: I think the Png or gift exports would be better than the Pdf on the Wiki

244
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.419
Matt Nelson: on the waiting. All right, that's fine,

245
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:20.189
Matt Nelson: that's all for me on that, I think the next topic is also me

246
00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.600
Matt Nelson: yeah distributions. This is again

247
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:35.030
Matt Nelson: just something to put on the radar. I don't think that I have anything to. I have a document around this, but I think it's a little early to share.

248
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:45.159
Matt Nelson: I think we should focus on the code ownership process first, and then this will kind of fall a little bit into that. But within the at least within the consensus team we've discussed,

249
00:32:45.170 --> 00:33:03.990
Matt Nelson: You know, how do we Basically, provide different distributions depending on what you need. So it could be public network distributions. It could be an ethereum specific distribution. It could be a private network, specific distribution. Um, and it could be, you know, whatever right, but just an evm distribution. So I think that the the goal here is to

250
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:14.670
Matt Nelson: remove some kind of legacy vestigial code in some of these distributions, and get a little bit more leaner. It's also kind of the first step towards

251
00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:33.559
Matt Nelson: the modularization and environmentalization is intentionally decoupling the code, so that we have a release that works just for that network. And I think that the reasoning being is because we would have to ensure that the interfaces don't have dependencies across some of the borders that I showed on the architecture diagram.

252
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.130
Matt Nelson: Um!

253
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.730
Matt Nelson: And I think that

254
00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:42.549
Matt Nelson: this would be a really kind of easy way for also users to not be

255
00:33:42.560 --> 00:34:10.879
Matt Nelson: confused about what they're getting for. Users to log issues a lot more efficiently within Github, and for us to much more easily debug issues on public numbers versus private versus non ethereum versus ethereum like it'll, It'll just make our lives a lot easier as code maintainers. So I do have a doc. I think it's again. I think we should focus on code ownership first, and what that looks like, and then I can tie this discussion back to that. I also think this is a lot of a post-merge context,

256
00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:15.990
Matt Nelson: because it will be an exercise that will allow us to remove a lot of the merge specific

257
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:28.319
Matt Nelson: code that is only focused on the transition itself. So it'll be a tech that exercise for a number of reasons. And I think again, our goal is here is to

258
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:45.889
Matt Nelson: make sure that everyone has the right distribution at their leaner distributions. We have a lot less intertwining dependencies, and it's step one on the kind of modularity discussion that's going to help enable a lot of those other use cases, you know, because maybe we have a roll-up distro,

259
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:51.000
Matt Nelson: you know, like we we kind of go up and down the stack providing different pieces, for different, you know you,

260
00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:57.320
Matt Nelson: or at least some method for users to build what they need. But But yeah, so that's that's the discussion.

261
00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:12.140
Matt Nelson: Any thoughts on initially, I I can share the doc now. It's just early. Um! I don't want to provide. I don't want to dump too much on this group of like administrative overhead right now. So whatever you folks think is appropriate, let me know, and I can share this.

262
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:26.519
Danno Ferrin: I think your instinct is right to wait until the Merge lands before we look at the next steps. Because I've also brought in other things in mind. What are we doing about Shanghai? Do we have a plan? Does Shanghai have a plan yet? I don't think you might be awkward dose of

263
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:35.629
Gary Schulte: come back to revisit that. So that's going to be hot on it, because I've got some Ebm stuff that i'm looking to bring in once. It's firm, but it's still too squishy.

264
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:45.699
Gary Schulte: I think there's official markdown for what constitutes Shanghai currently. But

265
00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:49.100
Gary Schulte: yeah, there Hasn't been much talk about that since since that was defined.

266
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.440
Gary Schulte: Yeah, they had signed it

267
00:35:50.450 --> 00:36:05.969
Gary Schulte: every time it gets on the Acg. Again All court Downs agenda. It gets pushed off because of marriage issues, and we haven't had any real Shanghai discussions for six months, and then suddenly it includes dank sharding. And um yeah, the evm stuff is still approved, and

268
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:13.679
Gary Schulte: that are transient things in there. Not but that's not for today. That's for the future, and that's just to put in mind

269
00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.879
Danno Ferrin: Cool anything else on this.

270
00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.209
Danno Ferrin: All right, if not,

271
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.540
Danno Ferrin: these last two are kind of mine and kind of related

272
00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:49.960
Danno Ferrin: um. So one of the things that you know, pushing it out to me exchanges this a bit. I might want to change my plan on this, but a big thing we want to do, and the two thousand two hundred and ten release cycle is to move off of Circle Ci on github actions

273
00:36:50.650 --> 00:37:10.579
Danno Ferrin: um on discord. Um ride told us that there might be limited supply of credits left on Circle Ci, and that hyper ledger may not be um topping it off again. I don't know if push comes to show if that's what would happen, but he's kind of nudging us towards doing Github actions,

274
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:26.070
Danno Ferrin: and Auntswan took the time to get. You have actions working with our current build set up. There's still a couple of themes like art Factory publishing is not finished yet, But this is one of the things that I think should be some of the first stuff into the Beta release, because we should try and migrate to get have actions.

275
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:45.700
Danno Ferrin: Um. This also solves another problem in that circle. Ci Isn't Really, Java, seventeen build-based friendly. Right Now the kin of actions is so we can move the build to Java seventeen, and then once we're stable on Java seventeen, we can unlock Javas seventeen language features which we'll.

276
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.910
Danno Ferrin: It'll be useful in a number of um.

277
00:37:47.930 --> 00:38:01.700
Danno Ferrin: A number of cases. The one I'm most excited about is Java records that solves a lot of our inequality issues. We can change migrate from the immutability library to records which is again going to have

278
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:10.080
Danno Ferrin: much friendlier in Java. Twenty one implications for for a lot of the compilation features that are going to come up with performance-wise.

279
00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:21.579
Danno Ferrin: So that's why I have my eye on Java, Seventeen features. Because we've been using records at era, and they're they're pretty amazing for what they are. It's it's really strange writing in twenty five lines of code and twenty four of it is, the

280
00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:35.010
Danno Ferrin: you know, twenty-two of it is the license euler plate, and then an import statement, and then one line of a record That's It's kind of weird to get used to it first, but it solves so many um performance and renewability problems. It's it's great,

281
00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:36.799
Danno Ferrin: it's

282
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.700
Danno Ferrin: so

283
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:56.649
Danno Ferrin: i'm wondering if we should start a uh a ci branch. It only has that that merges everything in from Maine. But does Github action built so we can check and see if things are working. They call that an early two thousand two hundred and ten Beta branch and start that earlier rather than later. What do people think about that?

284
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:01.409
Gary Schulte: I think that seems reasonable.

285
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:17.389
Gary Schulte: I would. I wanted to lodge a but not a complaint, but just an observation that I think this is a good tactical move for Hyper Ledger Basu. But I just I don't think that Github is really

286
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:36.270
Gary Schulte: ah in in line with the permissionless censorship resistance. Ah goals and ethos of hyper, ledger, basu and ethereum in general. So I, although I think this is a good tactical move, I think increasing. Our alliance on Github is not my favorite course of action, given recent

287
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.620
Gary Schulte: activity by Microsoft and Github. Specifically

288
00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.080
Danno Ferrin: i'm a circle, c. I better than that regard

289
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.470
Gary Schulte: I didn't b him. Ah,

290
00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:58.580
Gary Schulte: they didn't go well and beyond on multiple occasions, like A with the Lib and Vx fiasco, and with the tomato cash, fiasco, and so forth, like

291
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:04.390
Gary Schulte: it's. They seem to be over zealously compliant ahead of any asks

292
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.050
Gary Schulte: uh right in in regards to censorship.

293
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:08.390
Gary Schulte: It's

294
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.389
Danno Ferrin: You know what I think. I'll drop that stink bomb on the Tsc.

295
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.439
Danno Ferrin: Let's see how people think about it.

296
00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.950
Gary Schulte: Yeah, it is a stink bomb that's for sure.

297
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:22.549
Gary Schulte: Because what's been done is odious. Just just banning code, because

298
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:26.319
Danno Ferrin: without firm public disclosure.

299
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:42.580
Danno Ferrin: Yeah, What right? Because the Tsc. Is only code sourcing right now is Github um. They used to do Garrett, and let people source their own, but They've moved everything to Github. So what alternative would there be to Github to host it? What? Where could I direct that discussion?

300
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:52.619
Gary Schulte: Yeah, there's not a great, not a lot of great options. I've not heard of bit Bucket, or any of the other providers with that type of strong arm behavior,

301
00:40:52.770 --> 00:41:05.300
Gary Schulte: but it's still a centralized entity, and still subject to that type of you know, capture in terms of censorship. I just want to raise the issue that I think that

302
00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:22.089
Gary Schulte: the platform that we are on in the platform. That we're doubling down on is runs counter to our ethos, and we should be looking at other alternatives, and I don't have great alternatives. I just wanted to raise the issue that I think it could be a long term challenge.

303
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.499
Danno Ferrin: How about get left?

304
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.479
Gary Schulte: Yeah, you have toaster. I'll get Laverne as good have to the kid. Laughter the hosting.

305
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:33.489
Gary Schulte: I don't know i'd have to look into it. Honestly, I don't know I don't know that any of the other

306
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.689
Gary Schulte: you either have as strong a

307
00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:46.999
Gary Schulte: you know. Ci. Our actions type of platform that we would be able to leverage. So some some more research. You know we have to do some. We're looking into what alternatives are.

308
00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.879
Gary Schulte: I would, anyway,

309
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.370
Danno Ferrin: right because we would need we would need c. I support him?

310
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.749
Danno Ferrin: We would, if we're serious about this. We want a non github alternative for co-hosting

311
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:05.539
Gary Schulte: definitely. Just. I just want to get. I just want to get a battle plan to offer up before I raise this issue with the Tsc.

312
00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.509
Danno Ferrin: So i'll think about it. You might write something in the Csc. Channel this week,

313
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.639
Danno Ferrin: because one of one of my concerns is

314
00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:34.180
Gary Schulte: is, they might say, Well, we're We're all in on regulated um on regulated exchanges. So we really want to double down on commitment to regulation friendly people. And so there's one one concern I have is that some some of the the companies might say, Well, we like that. They're super aggressive. So that's one

315
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:43.989
Danno Ferrin: conflict I see is potentially. I don't know if that'll happen. But that's kind of the worst case scenario, by considering how odious the actions were.

316
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.740
Danno Ferrin: I think it's worth having the discussion

317
00:42:49.360 --> 00:43:07.430
Justin Florentine: so real quick. Um! So going back to the actual actions themselves. Uh, you said that I had um an implementation there. My last uh familiarity with Github actions. Uh said you kind of had to run your own runners where you used Github's action runners.

318
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.049
Justin Florentine: Is there a centralization concern there?

319
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.969
Danno Ferrin: So um

320
00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:28.170
Danno Ferrin: rye has a M. One, Mac, on his desk in his office that he runs a lot of the soling builds off of. We can specify external runners, or we can run it on Github and on their runners. It's about the same centralization risk as Circle Ci:

321
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.549
Justin Florentine: Yeah.

322
00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.290
Justin Florentine: So okay,

323
00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:42.370
Danno Ferrin: And i'll often look into that to get more comfortable with where the actual vendors live. So here's a thought experiment. Can we run? Build not on Ci, but on local machines, and verify it

324
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.949
Justin Florentine: right? That's what I've seen done in the past?

325
00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:56.420
Danno Ferrin: So we're not beholden to us. To a Cdi provider. We can still run our builds. If Circle Ci suddenly decides. We hate cryptocurrency.

326
00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:05.290
Gary Schulte: Not that you know, major hosts have decided suddenly No cryptocurrency hosting weeks before the merge

327
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:07.960
Danno Ferrin: just hypothetically

328
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.509
Gary Schulte: Right? Yeah,

329
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.390
Danno Ferrin: it hurts.

330
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.959
Gary Schulte: I mean, we've already had that research plan.

331
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:26.919
Danno Ferrin: But the stuff, Diego put in with the verified hashes, I think, is a step towards reproduced, fully reproducible builds,

332
00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.289
Gary Schulte: and we have a need to do things like um

333
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:38.859
Danno Ferrin: not put dates in the jars to get fully reproducible jars, because that's one way that impacts the compilation.

334
00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:47.309
Danno Ferrin: So that's that's That's past. We would go down if we see things deteriorate. So I think there's a path we can go down if if we need to.

335
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.470
Danno Ferrin: All right. This is gonna be like a whole initiative, which is cool.

336
00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:03.610
Danno Ferrin: It is, but it's one of those things it's like we have to act, or do we have to be willing to act? You know one of those things. Are we willing to pull the trigger, or do we have to pull the trigger?

337
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:15.009
Gary Schulte: I don't think we have to pull the trigger until we do right. It's one of those inevitability is that, like once it happens. If it happens, it's sudden, and you're so well,

338
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:20.709
Gary Schulte: it's the difference between drafting a lawsuit and filing a lawsuit, and what you said to your party.

339
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.369
Justin Florentine: Yeah. Unfortunately, it's the same amount of work.

340
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.089
Danno Ferrin: Yeah,

341
00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:36.079
Gary Schulte: thanks for agreeing to take that up with the Tsc. Then I think that is the kind of exposure that the topic needs.

342
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:46.000
Danno Ferrin: Let me capture this down uh in terms of my Github Um censorship

343
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:49.339
Danno Ferrin: phrase

344
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:16.329
Danno Ferrin: All right, ten minutes left. These are these American calls are quite busy compared to the Australian calls

345
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.580
Danno Ferrin: other business

346
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:25.730
Danno Ferrin: maintainer definition who's Sally Cream and Madeline Aren't on the call? He knows. What is this?

347
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.660
Justin Florentine: Um!

348
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:47.890
Gary Schulte: Oh, I think I think I have some context for that like um. The I think this is with relation to the validator program. Are we going to recognize non-code contributors non non-commit based contributions like

349
00:46:47.900 --> 00:47:06.450
Gary Schulte: I know, Msian has done a lot of work regarding performance, investigation, discovery, and that type of work that has artifacts. But it's not specifically that work in any way. It is not specifically tied to commits that are trackable in that way like these.

350
00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:13.379
Gary Schulte: It's not really a non-code contribution but in terms of the repository. It's a non-code contribution. So I think that that's what that conversation is about.

351
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.290
Danno Ferrin: Yeah,

352
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:25.710
Danno Ferrin: and that there's really one that needs. We have a Tim. And ef involved we need all parties on here, especially the decision-makers on it,

353
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:31.020
Danno Ferrin: because I remember some of the discord discussions I had, and there was a big focus on

354
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:37.170
Danno Ferrin: the people who make things work are the more important bits,

355
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.120
Danno Ferrin: you know. There was just Yeah, it was it.

356
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:48.650
Danno Ferrin: They went a lot of different directions, and the question is, what's the if willing to fund? So with that, Tim, it's not really discussion that much can be progressed on.

357
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:57.159
Gary Schulte: When do we do? We regularly meet with Tim for the Ef in general about the maintainers.

358
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:58.189
Gary Schulte: No,

359
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.690
there's an email thread that i'm on that there's another story that goes along with that I won't share.

360
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:21.689
Danno Ferrin: Um, that's if there's this occasion one days to come up there's not much that goes on with it, just you know. Hey, Can you get your agreements in, and there's no real like centralized discussion about it. Eventually, stuff's going to match me so, and I don't even know what the addresses of our of our validators are. I think that's one thing that I think should be shared. So all those room pretty well.

361
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.230
Gary Schulte: I have some updates in that regard.

362
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:34.979
Matt Nelson: Yeah. So the discussions with the Ef, like we we do need to finalize a lot of that stuff as far as agreements or concerns.

363
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:44.079
Matt Nelson: Unfortunately, it's one I've recalled that email thread which is kind of a complete mess at this point in time. We're waiting on some

364
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:53.539
Matt Nelson: hyper ledger legal to provide some comment back. If they have, I know we didn't know. I followed up on this last week, so if you

365
00:48:54.630 --> 00:49:11.090
Matt Nelson: and if if if action is not with Hyper ledger, i'll make sure to kind of share with the group. Um. But in the short term we haven't even set up an address around the validator awards. So I also kind of kick started that process, and it will. It will be shared because we need to understand the requirements with the Ef one

366
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:19.270
Matt Nelson: and the split between hyper, ledger and consensus. At the same time, I think the Hyper Ledger Foundation will also need to set up their own

367
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.720
Danno Ferrin: like cold wallet situation. Um, it's not about this.

368
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.209
Danno Ferrin: I'm sorry

369
00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.689
they'd know that they need to set it up for almost a year. So

370
00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:46.040
Matt Nelson: yeah, So I think that the a lot of the actions are still a hyper ledger, and we will in the short term we will collect the rewards basically to a consensus address. But we can just send them in accordance with the agreement to wherever we need. And then, once we have an an address that's been out for age left, we can

371
00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:55.189
Matt Nelson: start diving up their awards because their Ef. Is supposed to put in place a contract which automatically divvies up the rewards. But that doesn't work, if there's no

372
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.369
Matt Nelson: address, right? So we need um.

373
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.580
Danno Ferrin: It's back in the for the call. Guild splits.

374
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.589
Matt Nelson: What's that

375
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.389
Danno Ferrin: like the protocol that builds splits the

376
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.189
Matt Nelson: contract.

377
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:25.959
Matt Nelson: Yeah, there's there's gonna be a split contract. We need to get all the addresses finalized before we can actually put it in place. In the interim the the rewards will just be sent to an address owned by consensus, and we can just split the rewards of like on the day that the the splitter contract goes into effect. We can just split the rewards up to that point based on the contract.

378
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:33.510
Gary Schulte: Right? So more than just the splitter address I was. But just it, you know. I think I should add access to what the validator numbers are,

379
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:43.790
Gary Schulte: and we There's also in the contract discussions about um. If I needed to get access to the to the um the canary notes in case I need to debug something.

380
00:50:43.800 --> 00:51:01.059
Matt Nelson: Yeah, we should discuss. We should set up a meeting with Fabio Um, Gary and the contributors, just so that we can take a look at what the architecture looks like right now. Um, because that's a good point like we want. The Canaries are in theory there for the project, right? So everyone should be able to have access. I think that we intended to have

381
00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:06.549
Matt Nelson: like an open thing. But, Gary, we should just double-check on what that would look like.

382
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:31.250
Gary Schulte: So to clarify Dano, do you? Are you talking about access to the canary nodes that are like non-validating nodes, or just participating nodes Or are you more interested in having direct access to the the validator notes the the Ef incentive program validator notes, cause they're they're actually on separate separate authentications and separate separate networks are entirely isolated. So you can have access to either separately,

383
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.289
Danno Ferrin: Right? So the first thing is, I want to know what the validator addresses are.

384
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:48.430
Danno Ferrin: Um! What they do show up. If I were to go to be contained. I could look them up and say, Okay, they're happy, cool. Um. And you know we probably don't want to have that spread ranch. That would be Livington's maintainer than their um.

385
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.200
Danno Ferrin: What are we calling them

386
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.090
Danno Ferrin: uh payment or contributors, or whatever

387
00:51:54.100 --> 00:52:04.019
Danno Ferrin: it may not code contributors to the patrons they should be aware of what those are. Those shouldn't necessarily be, you know, posted on, be contained Io. Or reconciliation.

388
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:14.699
Gary Schulte: But I think you know those who participated should be aware of what they are. But as far as the code access, it would only be the canary set that is actually participating in the network,

389
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:29.890
Gary Schulte: because there's one hundred and twenty eight that they're that we're judged against. And then there's thirty-two and they get the numbers right. There's more it's more than that? Um: yeah, it's one hundred and forty, four, total, one hundred and forty, four. Total, right? It's. Yeah, it's one one, or what's being a judge for performance.

390
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:34.690
Gary Schulte: Yeah. And then there's sixteen that are less tightly scrutinized.

391
00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:48.820
Danno Ferrin: Yeah, the six sixteen are are, I think they call them the canaries, and the sixteen, I think is what the agreement says that if needed well, that that that the uh the Maintainer should have access to um on the presumption of good behavior. Um

392
00:52:48.830 --> 00:53:10.790
Danno Ferrin: um you know I don't know how we would do that, but the the one hundred and twenty-eight it would be reasonable for the node operators to to lock down and say, we don't want to risk it. So I think that you know i'm not asking for the access, but just that there is a way to get it in case there is a change split and a needed but like slides, software. And that's really why I put that question in in case I need to get in there to something. That's why

393
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:18.400
Gary Schulte: I think that what confused me was the collision between the term canaries which you know historically is meant,

394
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:28.590
Gary Schulte: you know, just Ec: two Amazon nodes that are are canaries for different releases on different networks that are not necessarily have any kind of financial liability.

395
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:37.190
Gary Schulte: But yeah, okay, I see what you mean. Currently those I think all one hundred and forty four have the same access control methodologies. That's something. We should talk to Fabio about.

396
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.209
Gary Schulte: Yeah. But I mean, really, if there's a problem,

397
00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:44.550
Gary Schulte: and there's a change. But I don't think we only want to have

398
00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:54.490
Gary Schulte: you know, contributors with access to just the non, you know. Just there's sixteen. I don't know what to call them. I don't want to call them canaries, but I don't remember

399
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:59.669
Gary Schulte: have notes. They were. Yeah. So I think the contractor was written was that

400
00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:11.950
Danno Ferrin: the the Node operator couldn't unreasonably deny access to the deaf nodes, but they could deny access to the one hundred and twenty-eight performance nodes without um on their own judgment. So I think that's what the distinguishment between those two were

401
00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:17.449
Danno Ferrin: that a main net developer can say, no. I want access to this node to get a look at the log of Yadda Yadda,

402
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:24.729
Danno Ferrin: but at one hundred and twenty eight the Node operator had reasonable cause to say news performance. We're going to. We're going to lock it down to just our devops people.

403
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:34.390
Gary Schulte: Okay, we probably won't have any movement on that until next week, just because Fabio is out and he really is kind of like the the validators are He's really.

404
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:42.589
Gary Schulte: Yeah, it's his baby, and we're all well aware of it. It's not like he's a centralization risk, but he definitely is the subject matter expert.

405
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:48.249
Gary Schulte: I'm not worried about Flop. You go. I'm worried about some vegan cannonade accounting. So that's where my concerns are coming from.

406
00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:49.089
Danno Ferrin: So

407
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.790
Danno Ferrin: yeah, some in Canada they have yet to hire an accounting.

408
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:59.399
Danno Ferrin: That's where my defense of this comes from. Is the future unknown of accountants and lawyers.

409
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:08.570
Gary Schulte: So so yeah, they're aware that we have a very unique circumstance, as far as like

410
00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:23.429
Matt Nelson: consensus nonsense accounting goes like they're also aware that these this is to be like. We. They know what's going on with as far as these splits um to reiterate, though, for the group our performance period doesn't start until a couple months after withdrawals are enabled.

411
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:32.679
Matt Nelson: So we have kind of a long time before we're actually held liable for the performance of these validators. But it's something we should discuss when the time comes, because we

412
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:38.040
Matt Nelson: it's. Yeah, it's going to be a thing right, And it could happen sooner than we think.

413
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:56.759
Danno Ferrin: Should the performance metrics be a standing item in the we in the bi-weekly meetings they should be. They're pretty lenient um it's like ninety five percent participation which most of the basic nodes hover around. But again they hover right. So we need to make sure. Yeah, we we should add that

414
00:55:56.770 --> 00:56:14.299
Danno Ferrin: starting probably in twenty twenty-three. Um, because Yeah, so it's it's. I believe the contract spells out some at some period of time following withdrawal enablement is when they'll let us know they'll let us know that it's happening. But we need to make sure that by that point in time that we're meeting the performance criterion, which is like

415
00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:24.130
Matt Nelson: some of them are lenient, and some of them are not so lean. So we just need to make sure that we're hitting those targets and It should be kind of a stay-ending point of discussion, because we don't want to lose

416
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.510
The risk is just that we lose out on those validator

417
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.450
Matt Nelson: keys. Um. So we don't make it doesn't happen

418
00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:36.700
Danno Ferrin: cool.

419
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:43.790
Danno Ferrin: I'm like for meeting. Are there any critical things I need to be talking about optimistic support or new editions? Or can those be rolled over to the

420
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.839
Danno Ferrin: I. These are olds. I don't.

421
00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.389
Matt Nelson: But yeah, I think we covered everything we can.

422
00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:54.609
Matt Nelson: I've been super bad about discussing the roadmap, but It's very

423
00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:58.469
Matt Nelson: in flux right now. Um:

424
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:08.449
Danno Ferrin: yeah. And some of the pairing improvements and stuff are better served by the Oceania call, anyway, because they're done by that team.

425
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:10.770
Danno Ferrin: All right.

426
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.759
Danno Ferrin: There we go.

427
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:18.009
Danno Ferrin: Uh, Does it? Do we need a continuous call, or can we end it? Because I've got a meeting? I really need to get to.

428
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:19.899
Justin Florentine: We're good.

429
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.370
Gary Schulte: Yep. All good

430
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:23.209
Danno Ferrin: thanks for praying.

431
00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.829
Gary Schulte: Thanks for coming, of course. Thank you.
