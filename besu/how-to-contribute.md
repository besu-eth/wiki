# How to Contribute

We would love to have your contributions to Besu. The [Start Here](../besu/start-here.md) page has some basic info. In addition, 

- If you're even thinking about making any changes to Besu code, set up your [github signoff](../besu/contributing/dco.md) so you don't have to worry about the DCO check.
- If you're submitting a PR, you might need to add to the [changelog](../besu/developing-and-conventions/changelog.md). 
- If you're adding a new CLI option, take a look at the [Besu CLI Style Guide](../besu/developing-and-conventions/besu-cli-style-guide.md).
