# Client Incentive Program

  

A diverse set of clients is key to the Ethereum network’s health and decentralization. To ensure that client teams have a strong incentive to maintain the core Ethereum network over the long term, the Ethereum Foundation has launched a Client Incentive Program. This program offers client teams ETH-denominated rewards which unlock over time, as long as they continue to build software which meets the performance and security requirements of mainnet.

Specifically, teams in the program will receive a total of 144 validators (4608 ETH) each to operate on mainnet. The size of these grants recognizes both the excellent work performed over the past few years and the many development challenges expected well into the future. 

You can [read the full announcement](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/13/client-incentive-program/) on the blog of the Ethereum Foundation.
