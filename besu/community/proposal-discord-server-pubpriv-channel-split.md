# Proposal: Discord Server Pub/Priv Channel SplitÂ 

Objective: Split the existing chat channels into two distinct sections: one for users on Ethereum Mainnet/public networks, and another for those developing private networks using Besu.

Rationale: This modification aims to ensure both types of users receive appropriate support. By segregating the channels, we can create a focused environment for relevant discussions, debugging, insights sharing, and collaboration. This will also enable new developers and contributors to assist each other more efficiently.

Potential Drawbacks: Users may initially find the new structure confusing, and the channels may appear more segregated. Besu maintainers may need to context switch more frequently to support users in the right place.

Mitigation Plan: To address these issues, we could create a more comprehensive onboarding guide in the discord to navigate the new structure. We could also consider new discord roles to tag certain sets of maintainers (i.e. public-focused maintainer)

Thoughts and feedback on this proposal are welcome!
