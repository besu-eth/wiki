# Besu Roadmap & Planning

This document represents the current working roadmap for Besu. It is a living document, which will evolve and change over time. In particular the features in later versions are likely to change.

We use the approach of #now, #next, #later [used by foursquare](https://medium.com/@noah_weiss/now-next-later-roadmaps-without-the-drudgery-1cfe65656645), with a slightly different time horizon. Our #now scale is about 3 dmonths, #next about 6 months, and #later is 12+ months.  

The enterprise roadmap is currently led by [Matthew Whitehead](mailto:matthew.whitehead@kaleido.io) from Kaleido. To discuss the enterprise roadmap items reach out to [matthew.whitehead on the discord server](https://discord.com/invite/hyperledger).
